<p>CHINA could join forces with the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan to seize power in the Middle East as US and NATO troops back down after 20 years of bloodshed, experts have said.</p>



<p>Beijing has been waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce on a trade deal with Kabul by extending its $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor into <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a> as part of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15505505" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663230117-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15505505" width="960" height="675" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>All US and NATO troops have left Bagram Air Base after 20 years in Afghanistan[/caption]



<p>Afghanistan has been engulfed by violence since the late 1970s, destroying its infrastructure and economy &#8211; but the nation&#8217;s security is vital for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">China&#8217;s</a> global domination under the BRI, which will span 60 countries.</p>



<p>Multiple players are circling to take advantage of the power vacuum and the country faces an uncertain future with Taliban attacks rampant and the threat of civil war looming.</p>



<p>It means China wants to assert its dominance in Afghanistan to maintain political stability in the region &#8211; and expand its economic interests, Robert Clark, from the Henry Jackson Society, said.</p>



<p>&#8220;China has economic interests in Afghan, it is a huge mineral deposit base with zinc and cobalt needed for microchips and under US sanctions China is forced to produce their own microchips,&#8221; Clark told The Sun Online.</p>



<p>&#8220;China is a silent partner.&nbsp;China would also be worried that terror groups could threaten their security.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SECURITY THREAT</h2>



<p>Muscling in on Afghanistan would give Beijing a strategic foothold in the region with the country acting as a crucial trading hub connecting the Middle East, Central Asia and Europe, boosting China&#8217;s influence across the world at an estimated cost of $4 trillion.</p>



<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi confirmed Beijing wants to &#8220;substantially&#8221; expand its BRI projects into the shattered country and &#8220;deepen the dialogue mechanism&#8221; between the nations.</p>



<p>A lack of infrastructure and an abundance of natural resources makes Afghanistan a lucrative target of Chinese investment &#8211; but it also involves risks.</p>



<p>Taliban forces have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15467931/afghanistan-isis-taliban-seize-us-military-vehicle/">unleashed a reign of terror in recent weeks</a>&nbsp;and seized control of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15467931/afghanistan-isis-taliban-seize-us-military-vehicle/">a third of the country after the last of the American troops left</a>.</p>



<p>Hundreds of Afghan soldiers have <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15489598/taliban-surges-hundreds-soldiers-flee-afghanistan/">already fled across the border into neighbouring Tajikistan</a> as the terror group sweeps through the country and leaves it on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>China has already strategically built the Taxkorgan&nbsp;airport&nbsp;on Pamirs Plateau in the northwest Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region &#8211; which borders Afghanistan.</p>



<p>Ashok Swain, professor of peace and conflict research at Sweden&#8217;s Uppsala University, told The Sun Online: &#8220;China is fast becoming a major power player in the Middle East. </p>



<p>&#8220;The US troops&#8217; withdrawal from&nbsp;Afghanistan&nbsp;allows China to influence&nbsp;Afghanistan&nbsp;policy in the years to come.&#8221;</p>



<p>But Michael Kugelman, an expert in South Asian affairs, said China&#8217;s ambitious expansion into Afghanistan will depend on its relationship with the Taliban.</p>



<p>&#8220;It will depend in great part on whether China reaches an understanding with the Taliban, which will see its influence continue to grow whether it holds power or not,&#8221; he told the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-has-a-big-plan-for-post-us-afghanistan-and-its-worth-billions?ref=scroll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Beast</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;If the Taliban is okay with China building out infrastructure and other projects in Afghanistan, Beijing will be in a much better place.</p>



<p>&#8220;China could well bring the Taliban on board with BRI. </p>



<p>&#8220;The insurgents have said they will support development projects if they serve Afghan national interests.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Taliban offers a &#8220;more unified partner&#8221; to China, a source told the publication.</p>

<p>But Kugelman warned: &#8220;China will still face an extremely insecure environment, even if it gets Taliban buy-in for its projects.&#8221;</p>



<p>Colonel Richard Kemp, 62, who was sent to Kabul in 2003 to take command of British Forces, said the outlook for Afghanistan was &#8220;bleak&#8221; &#8211; and said there would be &#8220;severe implications for the West&#8221; too.</p>



<p>He told The Sun Online: &#8220;Countries will see the US withdrawal as the West abandoning them when times were hard, and it will embolden countries like Russia and China as it’s seen as sign of weakness from the US. </p>



<p>&#8220;China is trying to increase its influence everywhere in the world – and the US withdrawal will open the gates for China to work with the Taliban.&#8221;</p>



<p>He warned: &#8220;It will be portrayed as a defeat of the US and embolden jihadists, leading the more attacks on the West.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Pakistan &#8211; one of Beijing’s strongest allies &#8211; could prove a trump card for China in the expansion into Afghanistan.</p>



<p>Sudha Ramachandran, an analyst on South Asian political and security issues, said China could &#8220;achieve more success than the US in Afghanistan given its close ties with and enormous leverage&#8221; over Pakistan &#8211; one of Beijing’s strongest allies.</p>



<p>&#8220;China wants to ensure that instability in Afghanistan does not impact BRI adversely, and it wants to push Afghanistan to join CPEC or BRI,&#8221; Ramachandran told the Daily Beast.</p>



<p>An Indian government official said China could work with the Taliban &#8220;at the request of Pakistan&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can vouch that China will fund the rebuilding of Afghanistan through the Taliban via Pakistan,&#8221; the source the Financial Times. &#8220;China is Pakistan’s wallet. China at the request of Pakistan will support the Taliban.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said it sees China as a &#8220;welcome friend&#8221; and is hoping to talk to Beijing about investing in reconstruction work &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221;, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3140399/china-welcome-friend-reconstruction-afghanistan-taliban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South China Morning Post</a> reports.</p>



<p>But Fan Hongda, professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of the Shanghai International Studies University, warned Afghanistan could become a &#8220;hotbed for growing Islamic extremism&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though China has for a long time been extremely cautious about sending military forces overseas, if it is supported by a United Nations resolution, China might join an international peacekeeping team to enter Afghanistan,&#8221; he told the Financial Times.</p>



<p>&#8220;With continued turbulence, Afghanistan could easily become a hotbed for growing Islamic extremism, which would to some extent affect stability in Xinjiang.&#8221;</p>



<p>But Professor Anthony Glees, from the University of Buckingham, believes China will stay out of Afghanistan and just &#8220;watch very carefully&#8221;.</p>



<p>He told The Sun Online: &#8220;I think both Russia and China will do absolutely nothing, they will stay out of the place, although they will watch very carefully indeed for any interference by the&nbsp;Taliban&nbsp;forces in their own Muslim areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The more the&nbsp;Taliban&nbsp;are left to their own devices, the more they can hone their forces and their fellow Islamist &#8216;students&#8217; in the West.&#8221;</p>

					US forces have begun a full withdrawal from Afghanistan under the orders of US President Joe Biden after spending 20 years fighting to stablise the war-torn nation.				</p>

			<div>
<p>US forces have begun a full withdrawal from Afghanistan under the orders of US President Joe Biden after spending 20 years fighting to stablise the war-torn nation.</p>
<p>Some 456 British soldiers and 2,420 Americans &#8211; along with hundreds of other coalition troops &#8211; died during the war which was sparked by the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And the civilian casualties are estimated to have been almost 50,000.</p>
<p>Codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom, the US led an invasion off Afghanistan to oust the Taliban after al-Qaeda flew planes into the World Trade Centre and other US buildings in 2001.</p>
<p>The mission was to oust the Taliban, who were said to be harbouring terrorists and providing them a safe haven &#8211; including Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>What followed was nearly 20 years of grinding conflict as the US, its allies, and the Afghan security forces staged a grinding campaign to attempt to rebuild the country and beat back the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Taliban had ruled most of Afghanistan following the Afghan Civil War in the 90s &#8211; sparked by the withdrawal of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Western nations had actually supported the Taliban in the 80s as the ran an insurgency against the Soviet backed regime of Mohammad Najibullah.</p>
<p>However, after seizing power in 1996 &#8211; the Taliban brutally ruled Afghanistan and offered a safe haven to terrorist killers like Osama.</p>
<p>As the US war rolled on into the 2010s, Bin Laden was killed in May, 2011, in a US special forces raid in Abbotabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p>And since then there has been a slow withdrawal, with British troops officially ending combat operations in October 2014.</p>
<p>February 2020 saw a peace deal signed between the US and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, which agreed to a withdrawal &#8211; whoever the Afghan government criticised it as being done behind &#8220;closed doors&#8221;.</p>
<p>Taliban forces have since continued their operations and have been gaining ground &#8211; and the US continues to pull back its troops.</p>
<p>The war is seen as defeating the Taliban and improving the lives of the Afghan people who were once living under strict Islamic law and who now have free elections.</p>
<p>However, for some it is unfinished job which was mishandled &#8211; and that may 20 years on simply see a return to the dominance of the Taliban as they did pre-9/11.</p>

<p>And Kugelman said China&#8217;s capacity to fill the vacuum left by the United States &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t be overstated&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;There will certainly be a vacuum to fill, but we shouldn&#8217;t overstate China&#8217;s capacity to fill it,&#8221; he told the Daily Beast. </p>



<p>&#8220;With Afghanistan&#8217;s security situation sure to spiral out of control, there&#8217;s only so much China will be able to do to deepen its footprint.&#8221;</p>



<p>Experts have also warned that other countries in the region will seek to assert their dominance in Afghanistan.</p>



<h2>RUSSIA &#8216;STANDS READY&#8217;</h2>



<p>Russia will also look to exploit its current presence in the country, Clark warned.</p>



<p>And Nilofar Sakhi, lecturer in International Affairs at the George Washington University, said China, Russia and Iran will use Afghanistan &#8220;as a battlefield for their strategic competition with the United States&#8221;.</p>



<p>It comes as Russian military helicopters based in Tajikistan fired air-to-surface missiles during a training exercise on Tuesday as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a> said its forces were ready to help secure the border with Afghanistan.</p>



<p>President Vladimir Putin told Tajikistan President Emomali Rakhmon that the nation will help with the fallout from NATO&#8217;s exit from neighbouring Afghanistan if necessary.</p>



<p>The military exercise simulated an attack on illegal armed groups along with a convoy of cars, enemy firepoints and arms caches.</p>



<p>And tensions are mounting after a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15495944/taliban-calls-nato-and-us-troops-invaders/">Taliban spokesperson said it will treat NATO and US forces as &#8220;invaders&#8221;</a> if they fail to leave Afghanistan by September.</p>

<p>Suhail Shaheen promised the Taliban &#8220;would react&#8221; if troops are left in the country after the withdrawal, hours after the terror group seized control of nine districts.</p>



<p>The jihadis are now preparing to move on the capital Kabul after Afghan troops surrendered and retreated.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Taliban for now seem to be convinced they can take power forcefully,&#8221; political analyst Ramish Salehi said.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a fight that will determine&#8230; whether democracy will prevail against ideological forces.&#8221;</p>

<p>THE Taliban today claimed to have control of 85 per cent of Afghanistan after seizing a key checkpoint on the border with Iran.</p>



<p>Fighters tore down the Afghan government flag at Islam Qala hours after Joe Biden&#8217;s speech <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3246497/biden-mark-frerichs-american-abducted-taliban-afghanistan/">defending his decision to pull out all US troops</a>.</p>

<p>Taliban militants have waged a major offensive in recent weeks, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15395994/taliban-seizes-afghanistan-blitz-offensive-us-20-year-war/">seizing swathes of territory</a>, forcing thousands of soldiers to flee or surrender and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15467931/afghanistan-isis-taliban-seize-us-military-vehicle/">capturing an arsenal of US heavy weapons</a>.</p>



<p>They have been allowed to run rampant as the US, the UK and other nations withdraw the last remaining troops after almost 20 years of war.</p>



<p>Today video footage shared online showed two masked men on the roof of the customs checkpoint at Islam Qala.</p>



<p>Chants of Allahu Akbar can be heard as they tear the national flag from its pole.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/taliban/">Taliban</a> spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the strategic border town was &#8220;under our full control&#8221;.</p>



<p>The Afghan government immediately vowed to retake Islam Qala, the main crossing point for traded goods worth millions of dollars a month.</p>



<p>&#8220;All Afghan security forces including the border units are present in the area, and efforts are under way to recapture the site,&#8221; interior ministry spokesman Tareq Arian said.</p>



<p>Seizing the town completed a huge arc of territory from the Iranian border in the west to the Chinese frontier in the east.</p>



<p>Today a Taliban delegation in Moscow claimed the group now has control of 250 of Afghanistan’s 398 districts &#8211; which the Kabul government disputes.</p>

<p>Hours earlier, Joe Biden admitted it was “highly unlikely” the Kabul government would be able to control the entire country.</p>



<p>But he insisted he was right to end all US operations in August 31. Almost all western troops have already left, including Britain&#8217;s.</p>



<p>The 20-year war in Afghanistan has cost the US nearly $1trillion since the 2001 invasion to drive out the Taliban and Osama bin Laden&#8217;s al-Qaeda.</p>



<p>But Mr Biden claimed the mission was a success as the country has not been used to launch any attacks on the West since 9/11.</p>



<p>The president said of pressure to continue the deployment: &#8220;The status quo is not an option.</p>



<p>“I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan.”</p>



<p>Earlier this week US forces quietly left Bagram air base, once the centre of operations with 10,000 personnel stationed there.</p>



<p>They did not tell Afghan comrades they were going and set the lights on a timer to switch off 20 minutes after the last plane took off, the BBC reported.</p>



<p>That came after the Taliban <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15467931/afghanistan-isis-taliban-seize-us-military-vehicle/">seized hundreds of armoured trucks and artillery units</a> left behind by American forces.</p>



<p>Some US intelligence analysts fear the Taliban could seize control of the country within six months, according to an assessment distributed to officials in June.</p>

			<div>
<p>US forces have begun a full withdrawal from Afghanistan under the orders of US President Joe Biden after spending 20 years fighting to stablise the war-torn nation.</p>
<p>Some 456 British soldiers and 2,420 Americans &#8211; along with hundreds of other coalition troops &#8211; died during the war which was sparked by the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And the civilian casualties are estimated to have been almost 50,000.</p>
<p>Codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom, the US led an invasion off Afghanistan to oust the Taliban after al-Qaeda flew planes into the World Trade Centre and other US buildings in 2001.</p>
<p>The mission was to oust the Taliban, who were said to be harbouring terrorists and providing them a safe haven &#8211; including Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>What followed was nearly 20 years of grinding conflict as the US, its allies, and the Afghan security forces staged a grinding campaign to attempt to rebuild the country and beat back the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Taliban had ruled most of Afghanistan following the Afghan Civil War in the 90s &#8211; sparked by the withdrawal of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Western nations had actually supported the Taliban in the 80s as the ran an insurgency against the Soviet backed regime of Mohammad Najibullah.</p>
<p>However, after seizing power in 1996 &#8211; the Taliban brutally ruled Afghanistan and offered a safe haven to terrorist killers like Osama.</p>
<p>As the US war rolled on into the 2010s, Bin Laden was killed in May, 2011, in a US special forces raid in Abbotabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p>And since then there has been a slow withdrawal, with British troops officially ending combat operations in October 2014.</p>
<p>February 2020 saw a peace deal signed between the US and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, which agreed to a withdrawal &#8211; whoever the Afghan government criticised it as being done behind &#8220;closed doors&#8221;.</p>
<p>Taliban forces have since continued their operations and have been gaining ground &#8211; and the US continues to pull back its troops.</p>
<p>The war is seen as defeating the Taliban and improving the lives of the Afghan people who were once living under strict Islamic law and who now have free elections.</p>
<p>However, for some it is unfinished job which was mishandled &#8211; and that may 20 years on simply see a return to the dominance of the Taliban as they did pre-9/11.</p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>The Kabul government is now desperately trying to defend a string of provincial capitals, which have to be supplied by air after militants seized surrounding countryside.</p>



<p>On Friday Russia said the Taliban now had control of two-thirds of the border with Tajikistan.</p>



<p>Five districts in Herat fell without a fight, and more than 1,000 Afghan troops fled into Tajikistan to escape a Taliban onslaught.</p>



<p>Moscow fears the turmoil could allow Islamist terrorists to penetrate into the former Soviet states of central Asia, which it considers its back yard.</p>



<p>But the Taliban insisted they did not pose a threat to the wider region and they would &#8220;take all measures&#8221; to stop ISIS operating in Afghanistan.</p>



<p>President Ashraf Ghani has insisted Afghan security forces can keep the Taliban at bay without help from Nato.</p>



<p>On Wednesday his officials claimed troops had recaptured government buildings in the western city of Qala-e-Naw &#8211; the first major provincial capital entered by the Taliban in their summer offensive.</p>

<p>RUSSIANS who receive a Covid vaccine should be on a sex ban for three days after getting their jab, a health official has said.</p>



<p>The warning came as the nation seeks to boost its sluggish vaccine rollout after becoming the world’s first country to register a drug to combat the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15545427" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664802373.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15545427" width="960" height="628" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Russians have been advised not to have sex for three days after having a Covid jab[/caption]



<p>But despite their pharmaceutical success, infections and deaths have spiked in recent weeks as just 13 per cent of the population have received both vaccine doses.</p>



<p>Now the deputy health minister for the Saratov region, Dr Denis Graifer, 38, has urged Russians to stay away from activities that cause &#8220;increased physical stress&#8221; &#8211; including hanky panky &#8211; for three days.</p>



<p>He told a press conference, &#8220;I believe, and everyone knows this, too, that sex is a very energy-consuming activity.</p>



<p>&#8220;So we warn people who have been vaccinated that increased physical activity, including having sex, is not recommended after vaccination.&#8221;</p>



<p>The country have also warned individuals to avoid alcohol, smoking and visits to the sauna after receiving a vaccine &#8211; despite their being no evidence that these activities have any negative effect on the vaccine.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15545458" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664802369-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15545458" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Dr Denis Graifer has come under fire for his warning with other medics suggesting he has gone too far[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15545424" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664802368.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15545424" width="960" height="637" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Only 13 per cent of the population have received both jabs[/caption]



<p>But some health officials across the globe have suggested avoiding booze for a day after being jabbed.</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s Sputnik V rollout has been less popular than presumed due to some mistrust of the government and their slapdash execution of the programme.</p>



<p>The married father-of-two Graifer has himself been vaccinated.</p>



<p>Yet the qualified doctor and politician&#8217;s words of wisdom were publicly criticised on the Russian state media by a senior medical official who dismissed him as a &#8220;young colleague&#8221; who had been excessive with his sex ban.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can do it, just do it with caution,&#8221; his boss Oleg Kostin said in regards to the veto on lovemaking.</p>



<p>He instead suggested Russians should &#8220;have common sense and not overdo it.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15545506" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/38a53737-eebe-4ae8-bc58-00186c902dc7.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15545506" width="960" height="611" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Russians have not rushed to get their jabs over concerns with the government&#8217;s approach to the pandemic</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>As Russia muddles through its third wave, which is thought to have been exacerbated by the spread of the Delta variant, Moscow again came under fire for its Covid response.</p>



<p>The nation today announced a third wave record of 25,766 new infection cases and 726 daily Covid deaths.</p>



<p>The Economist wrote, &#8220;Hundreds of thousands are dead, partly thanks to the Kremlin&#8217;s incompetence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Russia is in the midst of its third and most severe wave of covid-19, with more people dying daily than at any point during the pandemic.</p>



<p>&#8220;The number of new daily cases is currently around 25,000, somewhat fewer than in Britain, and rising,&#8221; the newspaper added.</p>



<p>&#8220;But whereas in Britain this surge has translated into an average of 18 daily deaths over the past week, in Russia it has resulted in an average of 670 deaths a day.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15545487" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664802374.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15545487" width="640" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>The married father-of-two has been inoculated against Covid[/caption]



<p>&#8220;The contrast is all the more striking because Russia was the first country in the world to approve a working vaccine, one based on the same science as the British-Swedish AstraZeneca one and apparently just as effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;But whereas in Britain 78% of the population has received at least one jab, in Russia the proportion is only 20%.&#8221;</p>



<p>The publication touched on the people&#8217;s doubt in their leaders, writing: &#8220;The difference is not the availability or the efficacy of the jab, but people&#8217;s trust in the government and its vaccines.&#8221;</p>



<p>Putin’s government had &#8220;other priorities&#8221; like jailing his political foe Alexei Navalny and banning street protests, the report claimed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s official Covid death toll is 141,501, although critics say the true figure is much higher. </p>

<p>Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and Clinical Director of <a href="https://www.patientaccess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patientaccess.com</a>, said: &#8220;There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to abstain from sex after the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>



<p>&#8220;People who have the vaccine may develop side effects, including redness and soreness around the site of injection, muscle aches and fever. </p>



<p>&#8220;These side effects are usually mild and settle within a day or two. If you do have these symptoms, you may not feel like having sex, but it certainly won’t do any harm if you do want to,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>VILE scammers have set up a fake Caitlyn Loane fundraising page targeting loved ones after the young farmer’s suicide.</p>

<p>Caitlyn, a 19-year-old from Latrobe in Tasmania, Australia, became a sensation on the social media platform for documenting her daily life working in the agriculture industry.</p>



<p>But she died by suicide on Thursday, July 8.</p>



<p>The bubbly farmer &#8211; who had been working on the family&#8217;s 600-hectare property &#8211; was followed by more than 54,000 people on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/">TikTok</a>.</p>



<p>Hours after news emerged of her death, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime/">shameless fraudsters</a> tried to cash in by brazenly setting up a fake online crowdfunding page.</p>



<p>Caitlyn&#8217;s mum, Richele, warned on social media: &#8220;Sadly we have been notified of this page and implore everyone to not be caught up in it as it is a scam and not in any way authorised by family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sickeningly, the heartless scammers had even used a photo of Richele and Phillip Loane&#8217;s beloved daughter to con people into donating money.</p>



<p>Shocked at the scam, those who knew Caitlyn slammed it as “cruel and so wrong” and “beyond despicable”.</p>



<p>The phoney fundraiser was set up by someone with &#8220;no heart&#8221;, said one disgusted person.</p>



<p>Another lashed out: “For some low lives to do this as if you haven’t enough to deal with already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caitlyn’s final TikTok video was posted on June 26 and shows the teen lipsyncing to a popular audio that says: “How far would you drive for the girl of your dreams?”</p>



<p>In the caption, she wrote, “how about to Tasmania?” while the video flashes through pictures of her life.</p>



<p>Speaking of his daughter&#8217;s death, Phillip said: “Words can’t describe our loss.</p>



<p>“She was a lovely, crazy young woman who was an invaluable member of our family.”</p>



<p>Richele said her daughter’s “smile lit up the room” and that she “wasn’t afraid to get her hands dirty”.</p>



<p>She was described as a “very special girl” who was “loved by many and made so many people smile” in another post by a friend.</p>



<p>“You will be truly missed and some things will never be the same again, but you will remain forever young,” it read.</p>

<p>Fans have been flooding Caitlyn’s profile with tributes and condolences.</p>



<p>“Sad day for Tassie TikTok,” wrote a bewildered fan on her moving final video edit. “Your brilliant light will be missed. RIP,&#8221; they added.</p>



<p>“Rest in peace my beauty. You were too good for this world, ”said another.</p>



<p>In June, Caitlyn opened a farmer’s festival in Tasmania where she was involved in judging cattle.</p>



<p>She was also in the process of planting her first crop – a paddock of peas – and hoped to continue doing so for years to come.</p>



<p>Richele and Phillip said the teenage farmer had &#8220;a bright future&#8221; and there were no warning signs leading up to her death.</p>



<p>Today her mum said she was &#8220;still lost for words&#8221;.</p>



<p>She told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9770915/Parents-TikTok-star-took-life-warn-despicable-fake-crowdfunding-page-name.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail Australia</a>: &#8220;The are no answers for us, there&#8217;s no reasons, no whys.</p>



<p>&#8220;She had a crop in the ground. Her future was extremely bright.&#8221;</p>



<p>Richele said Caitlyn had been working on the farm &#8220;since she she was old enough to ride a four wheel bike, which was about eight&#8221;.</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;She was just an effervescent person, she loved run up to people and give them a big hug when she saw them.</p>



<p>&#8220;But she was wise beyond her years too. When she was 13 she wanted to be 18 and when she was 18 she wanted to be 25.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15545239" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 596px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664616900.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=586" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15545239" width="586" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Tiktok/@catieloane</figcredit></figure>Her TikTok has a following of over 50k people and 700k likes[/caption]



<p>Caitlyn, a fourth-generation farmer, had spoken about her career path to TasWeekend magazine during Agfest Tasmania, last month.</p>



<p>She said: “In 2018, I realised that school wasn’t giving me the skills and experience I needed, so I applied to the Sunday Creek Cattle Station, in the Northern Territory, so I could gain experience and learn more.</p>



<p>“Up there the properties are huge, and they muster with helicopters and on horseback.”</p>



<p>A friend said she would remember Caitlyn as a woman with a “bubbly personality and a heart of gold”, according to the Herald Sun.</p>



<p>Caitlyn had also played Aussie Rules football for local club Devonport.</p>



<p>It said in a tribute: &#8220;The Board, the members, players, volunteers, sponsors, and supporters of the Devonport Football Club convey our sincere condolences and warmest thoughts to Caitlyn’s family and friends, which, of course, includes her teammates in the DFC Senior Women’s team.&#8221;</p>

<p>THE dad of missing Brit&nbsp;Alice&nbsp;Hodgkinson says the family are at a &#8220;complete loss&#8221; after her tragic death was confirmed.</p>



<p>Steve Hodgkinson received the &#8220;worst news imaginable&#8221; from Japanese police who discovered his daughter&#8217;s body eight days after she went missing.</p>

<p>The family have been living in a constant state of fear and anxiety after the 28-year-old from Nottingham <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15497868/desperate-search-for-brit-woman-who-vanished-in-japan/">failed to turn up for work</a> at the English language school where she taught in&nbsp;Yokohama, near Tokyo, on July 1.</p>



<p>Authorities are treating her death as a suicide after discovering a note in her apartment, the contents of which are yet to be disclosed.</p>



<p>Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with her death.</p>



<p>Her worried friends in the country, where the Edinburgh University graduate had been living for more than a year, launched a poster campaign in a bid to find her.</p>



<p>Her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15510654/british-woman-missing-japan-alice-hodgkinson-dad-worried/">family in the UK faced an agonising wait for news</a> and desperately clung onto a glimmer of hope she could still be alive &#8211; although her dad admitted earlier this week: &#8220;We fear the worst.”</p>



<p>Retired computer software engineer Steve, 68, said at his Nottingham home he shares with 32-year-old son Peter:&nbsp;“We were notified last night. Police told me that they had found Alice’s body. It was the worst news imaginable.</p>



<p>“We are devastated and it is a very difficult time for our family.”</p>



<p>Steve &#8211; divorced from Alice’s mum NHS worker Julie, 63, who also lives in Nottingham &#8211; added:&nbsp;“We are at a complete loss and her mother is struggling, she’s beside herself with grief.”</p>



<p>The family want to repatriate her body as soon as possible.</p>



<p>He said he wasn&#8217;t yet sure if he and his son would be travelling to Japan, saying:&nbsp;“We’ve not decided what is best to do. If we go out there we’ll need to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks. But we need to bring Alice home.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added:&nbsp;“Close family are aware. It is not a murder investigation and police are not looking for anyone else in connection with her death.”</p>



<p>It is understood officers who broke into Alice’s apartment on July 1, after she was reported missing, found a note addressed to her dad and brother.</p>



<p>Steve was too upset to say where his daughter’s body was found or how she had died.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society &#8211; from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.</p>
<p>And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.</p>
<p>That is why&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youre-not-alone/">The Sun launched the You&#8217;re Not Alone campaign.</a></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others&#8230;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7194521/the-sun-suicide-prevention-campaign-launch/">You&#8217;re Not Alone.</a></p>

<p>Her heartbroken father had previously told how he was &#8220;anxiously waiting by the phone&#8221; for news on his daughter just days before her body was discovered.</p>



<p>She was last seen on June 29 but he had received an email from her the following day &#8211; the last one she sent.</p>



<p>He said:&nbsp;“I’d got a Father’s Day present from her, a membership to Sheffield University Theatre, and I responded with an email thanking her. </p>



<p>&#8220;She then sent an email in reply, that&nbsp;was our last communication and everything&nbsp;seemed absolutely fine.</p>



<p>“As far as we know she wasn’t depressed, she seemed to be leading a happy, fulfilling life.”</p>



<p>Hodgkinson, who last saw Alice in 2019 before she went to live abroad, said they had a&nbsp;“good relationship”.</p>



<p>Before her body was found, he said: &#8220;We are very very anxious. You hear of awful things happening all the time and my daughter wouldn’t just disappear.</p>



<p>“She has not been in contact with anybody. It is totally out of character and I’m afraid we fear the worst.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a heartfelt plea to his daughter, he said: “Alice, please, please make contact. So many people are concerned about you. You are very much loved. Please get in touch.”</p>



<p>He told how Interpol had joined forces with Nottinghamshire and Japanese police in the search for Alice as her frantic friends in the country where she has lived since March last year launched a poster campaign in a bid to help find her.</p>



<p>He described his single daughter as&nbsp;“a bright young lady and quite outgoing in sharing her views on veganism, animal welfare and human rights.</p>



<p>“She was a bit of a loner at times, not the partying type and not looking for a relationship,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>He told how Alice was reported missing after failing to turn up for work last week.</p>



<p>He explained:&nbsp;“She hadn’t been in work for a few days and her bosses were getting concerned for her wellbeing. They got the police involved and launched an investigation.</p>



<p>“We’ve desperately been trying to call her but her phone’s not doing anything. It’s either switched off or the battery is dead. She wouldn&#8217;t normally be out of contact for so long.</p>



<p>“Something’s wrong. It’s very worrying. We would normally speak face to face on Skype every four weeks and exchange the odd email in between.&#8221;</p>



<p>He told how Alice, who graduated from Edinburgh University with a Masters degree in Psychology, didn&#8217;t speak any Japanese but &#8220;relied on Google Translate”.</p>

<p>Alice shared an apartment block in&nbsp;Yokohama &#8211; 20 miles south of Tokyo &#8211; with different nationality tenants and intended to stay in the country for another year.</p>



<p>Nottingham-born Alice had travelled to Tokyo last March to teach English at an the Shane English School and had been living in the Kanagawa prefecture.</p>



<p>Alice&#8217;s brother Peter had also began an online appeal in hopes of finding his sister, explaining that UK and Japanese authorities were both working to locate the 28-year-old.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15544377" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 761px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664816595.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=751" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15544377" width="751" height="429" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>KUTV</figcredit></figure>It took less than three minutes for hackers to steal Brandon&#8217;s cypto stash[/caption]



<p>“Unfortunately it was a lookalike app and I gave access to my digital wallet to a hacker,&#8221; he told <a href="https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-man-loses-384000-in-cryptocurrency-scam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KUTV</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve shed a lot of tears, I’m not going to lie,&#8221; said Brandon.</p>



<p>The trader wanted to download the app for 1inch, an exchange for Ethereum &#8211; a type of blockchain currency &#8211; but unfortunately the actual app he downloaded was a similar-looking scam.</p>



<p>It took hackers three minutes to steal £278,000 (USD$384,006) from his account in March this year, according to Brandon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mentalawesomeness.com/intro-to-crypto-page">website</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Obviously this is devastating. Not only the immediate loss but the potential of the cryptocurrencies I had in the wallet will be worth no less than $1MILLION dollars in 2021,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>The crypto fanatic shared a screenshot of his account two hours before it was attacked to show his wife the progress he had made trading the volatile currency.</p>



<p>&#8220;Balance = $384,006 in this wallet. Total balance in all wallets before attack was about $691,000,&#8221; he explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;And 2 Hours Later…$0 Everything taken. It took them 3 minutes to clean me out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brandon is using his misfortune to warn others and offering Bitcoin courses to help fledgling traders.</p>

					CRYPTO scams are popping up all over the internet. We explain how to spot them. 				</p>

			<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promises of a high or guaranteed return </strong>&#8211; Does the offer look realistic? Scammers often attract money by making fake promises. </li>
<li><strong>Heavy marketing and promotional offers </strong>&#8211; If they are using marketing tricks to con customers you should beware. </li>
<li><strong>Unamed or non-existent team members</strong> &#8211; Just like any business you should be easily able to find out who is running it. </li>
<li><strong>Check the whitepaper</strong> &#8211; Every crypto firm should have a white paper. This should explain how it plans to grow and make money. If this doesn&#8217;t make sense, then it could be because the founders are trying to confuse you. </li>
<li><strong>Do your research</strong> &#8211; Check reviews online and Reddit threads to see what other people think. </li>
</ul>

<p>&#8220;Act now, because I don&#8217;t want ANYONE to experience being ROBBED like I was.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite his unlucky encounter, Brandon won&#8217;t to give up on his dream to become a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/14704689/why-is-the-crypto-market-down/">crypto millionaire</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;There’s still a tremendous opportunity to make money in crypto,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I’m still going to take advantage of that&#8221;.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/cryptocurrency/">Cyrptocurrencies</a> have taken off in recent years thanks to the support of big names like <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>.</p>



<p>In June, the price of Dogecoin, a form of crypto, surged once more after Musk backed new moves to massively slash its transaction fees.</p>



<p>Despite this, the cryptocurrency market crashed again this month, proving the volatile nature of coins like Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Etherum.</p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency on the market, is down nearly 7% over the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>It is currently around $32,370 according to&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinmarketcap</a>, and has nearly halved in value since it reached&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/14648594/bitcoin-price-time-high-second-day-running/">$64,000 in April.</a></p>



<p>The second biggest cryptocurrency,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/14802893/ethereum-what-is-price/">Etheruem</a>, has also dropped in value in the last 24 hours along with other popular coins like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/14843542/cardano-price-what-is/">Cardano</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/13909140/ripple-xrp-price-latest/">XRP.</a></p>



<p>It comes after a series of worldwide crackdowns on the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/15433433/withdraw-transfer-money-cryptocurrency-binance-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned from operating in the UK</a>&nbsp;by the country’s financial watchdog last month.</p>

<p>TENNIS ace Naomi Osaka has revealed that Meghan Markle reached out to her after she stepped down from the French Open.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/meghan-markle/">The Duchess of Sussex</a> is one of many famous faces who reportedly wanted to support the young tennis star after she quit amid the controversy over her press briefings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Osaka, 23, said that she had an outpouring of support from people in the public eye including <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michelle-obama/">Michelle Obama</a> and fellow sports stars <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michael-phelps/">Michael Phelps</a>, Steph Curry and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/novak-djokovic/">Novak Djokovic.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://time.com/6077128/naomi-osaka-essay-tokyo-olympics/">Time Magazine</a> for an Olympic preview issue, the athlete spoke about her decision to boycott media conferences <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/15122495/naomi-osaka-french-open-withdraws/">during the French Open</a>, having tweeted that she found the briefings like “kicking a person while they&#8217;re down”.</p>



<p>And the tennis ace said: “There can be moments for any of us where we are dealing with issues behind the scenes. Each of us as humans is going through something on some level.</p>



<p>“It has become apparent to me that literally everyone either suffers from issues related to their mental health or knows someone who does.</p>



<p>“I do hope that people can relate and understand it&#8217;s OK to not be OK, and it&#8217;s OK to talk about it.”</p>



<p>And she revealed she had received a swell of support from big names, including the Duchess of Sussex.</p>



<p>Meghan Markle had revealed just over two months before Osaka&#8217;s game that she herself had struggled with mental health.</p>



<p>Speaking in an explosive interview with Oprah, the Duchess of Sussex opened up about her own experience with depression, saying she had also <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14265865/meghan-harry-oprah-interview-suicidal-thoughts/">faced suicidal thoughts</a>.</p>



<p>Meghan broke down in tears as she revealed she told Prince Harry<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14265865/meghan-harry-oprah-interview-suicidal-thoughts/"> she &#8220;didn’t want to be alive any more&#8221; and had suicidal thoughts</a> in the shocking tell-all interview.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Sussex said she begged for help from the Firm after struggling with her mental health &#8211; saying it was her husband who &#8220;saved&#8221; her.</p>



<p>And just months after Meghan&#8217;s interview, Osaka found herself in the middle of a storm in May after she refused to attend a press conference at the French Open for mental health reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She pulled out of the tournament and has also skipped <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/wimbledon/">Wimbledon</a>, and has since revealed that she struggles with depression and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And Osaka said she wanted to see more support offered to athletes after her own experience in May.</p>



<p>In the cover issue of the magazine Osaka has called for sports stars to be allowed to use “sick days” in order to normalise skipping press conferences without having to explain themselves.</p>



<p>She also pointed out that personal or mental health days are given to workers in most other industries, and that it would bring sport “in line” with the rest of society.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She will return to competition at the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tokyo-2020-olympics/">Tokyo Olympics</a>, which open July 23, and where she will represent her native Japan.</p>



<p>The four-time Grand Slam champion said: “I have numerous suggestions to offer the tennis hierarchy.</p>



<p>&#8220;But my No. 1 suggestion would be to allow a small number of &#8216;sick days&#8217; per year where you are excused from your press commitments without having to disclose your personal reasons.</p>



<p>“In any other line of work, you would be forgiven for taking a personal day here and there, so long as it’s not habitual.</p>



<p>“You wouldn’t have to divulge your most personal symptoms to your employer; there would likely be HR measures protecting at least some level of privacy.”</p>

					EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.				</p>

			<div>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society &#8211; from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.</p>
<p>That is why <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youre-not-alone/">The Sun launched the You&#8217;re Not Alone campaign.</a></p>
<p>The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others&#8230; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7194521/the-sun-suicide-prevention-campaign-launch/">You&#8217;re Not Alone.</a></p>
<p>If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:</p>
<ul>
<li>CALM, <a href="http://www.thecalmzone.net/">www.thecalmzone.net</a>, 0800 585 858</li>

<p>Osaka explained that she felt under pressure to disclose her “personal medical history” to explain why she needed a break from the briefings.</p>



<p>She accepted that her profession is “privileged” and comes with commitments off court, but urged people to recognise that athletes “are humans.”</p>



<p>She added: “I can’t imagine another profession where a consistent attendance record (I have missed one press conference in my seven years on tour) would be so harshly scrutinized.</p>



<p>“Perhaps we should give athletes the right to take a mental break from media scrutiny on a rare occasion without being subject to strict sanctions.</p>



<p>“This was never about the press, but rather the traditional format of the press conference. I’ll say it again for those at the back: I love the press; I do not love all press conferences.”</p>



<p>“I have always enjoyed an amazing relationship with the media and have given numerous in-depth, one-on-one interviews, she said, adding that: &#8216;The way I see it, the reliance and respect from athlete to press is reciprocal.”</p>



<p>But she slammed the press conference “format” as “out of date” and insisted that it was “in great need of a refresh”.</p>

<p>Osaka has insisted that she is not attempting to start a “revolt” in the sport but hopes that changes can “enact measures to protect athletes, especially the fragile ones.”</p>



<p>The Japanese megastar hit out at organisations for “ignoring” the mental health of athletes, and was hit with a $15,000 fine by officials after failing to go to a press conference following her first-round match on May 30.</p>



<p>The four <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/15122495/naomi-osaka-french-open-withdraws/">Grand Slam organizers issued a joint statement</a> warning she would face “more substantial fines and future Grand Slam suspensions” if she continued her boycott.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A WOMAN was crushed to death by six giant karaoke screens as she celebrated her 35th birthday in a nightclub.</p>



<p>Horrifying CCTV footage shows Tatiana Pokhorenko on the dance floor seconds before the 440lb scaffold fell on her from above.</p>

<p>Tatiana died on the spot at the Gallery Club in Siberian city Surgut, eastern Russia.</p>



<p>She had gone there to celebrate her birthday with pals.</p>



<p>Footage played to a court shows Tatiana illuminated by blue lights while dancing under the six karaoke screens.</p>



<p>The screens &#8211; installed on a metal structure suspended from the ceiling &#8211; rise upwards before suddenly plunging 25ft to the floor.</p>



<p>Distressing video then shows staff and other clubbers pulling the scaffold off, revealing Tatiana lying motionless underneath.</p>



<p>Paramedics arrived soon after but the victim could not be saved.</p>



<p>David Skvortsov, who was DJing at the time, told local media: “I was lifting up the screens so that customers on the first floor could enjoy karaoke as well.</p>



<p>“At one point, the karaoke screens dropped down and killed the woman.”</p>

<p>Nightclub owner Semen Kopaigora pleaded guilty to causing death through negligence.</p>



<p>Presecutors said the businessman failed to make sure the screens were safe when he had them installed.</p>



<p>But he was spared jail, instead receiving a three-year suspended sentence earlier this week.</p>



<p>Judges at Surgut city court said the sentence was softened due to mitigating circumstances including his two young children.</p>

<p>A HEAVY metal addicted mum has named her babies Metallica, Pantera and Slayer in tribute to her favourite bands.</p>



<p>But she&#8217;s been slammed on Twitter for turning her children into targets for school bullies in New Zealand.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more, little Metallica&#8217;s second name is reportedly &#8220;And Justice For All&#8221; in honour of the American&#8217;s fourth studio album.</p>



<p>Journalist David Farrier stumbled upon the bizarre band tributes while researching a story for his <a href="https://www.webworm.co/p/metalbabies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebWorm newsletter</a> &#8211; which hones in on oddball Kiwis.</p>



<p>He revealed on Twitter that he was &#8220;proud to report that a New Zealand mother has named her children Metallica, Pantera and Slayer&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;She told me, &#8216;it&#8217;s not easy raising three of the heaviest bands&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/new-zealand/">New Zealand</a> has tough rules about the names that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/parenting/">parents</a> can give their babies &#8211; they can&#8217;t be called &#8216;Royal&#8217;, &#8216;Covid&#8217; or any swear words.</p>



<p>Yet the unnamed mum showed Farrier her kids&#8217; birth certificates, which seemed to confirm that little Metallica&#8217;s middle name is indeed “And Justice For All”.</p>



<p>So, an unbelieving Farrier double-checked with the Registrar-General.</p>



<p>And the moniker was apparently officially confirmed.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15541889" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 595px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2702bee8-cec2-4079-9b0e-be210e9e15ce.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=585" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15541889" width="585" height="459" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Twitter/davidfarrier</figcredit></figure>David Farrier wrote about the heavy metal inspired names[/caption]



<p>The stunned journo tweeted that he &#8220;became a bit suspicious&#8221; when she also included Metallica&#8217;s best album &#8216;And Justice For All&#8217; in her kid&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>&#8220;But New Zealand&#8217;s registrar-general [Jeff Montgomery] seems to confirm it&#8217;s a real thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Farrier included a quote from Montgomery&#8217;s reply: &#8220;There are no restrictions on naming babies after bands or albums as long as the word used is not generally considered to be offensive and does not resemble an official rank or title.</p>



<p>&#8220;This particular baby was registered in 2009 by the previous Registrar-General.</p>



<p>&#8220;A similar application made today is likely to also be approved.&#8221;</p>



<p>Farrier said: &#8220;So there you have it.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15541551" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 882px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-146.png?strip=all&amp;w=872" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15541551" width="872" height="567" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Above: David Farrier wrote about the bizarre names in his WebWorm newsletter</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<figure id="attachment_15542025" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 584px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-147.png?strip=all&amp;w=574" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15542025" width="574" height="289" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">But some people aren&#8217;t impressed with the kids&#8217; heavy metal names</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>He added on Twitter: &#8220;Plus, I&#8217;ve seen the birth certificates. </p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, waiting for comment from Metallica, Slayer and Pantera<br>as clearly this metal mother (and her kids) deserve free metal gigs for life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Finally, I think it&#8217;s important to note (as you can see in the photo in my article) this mother is also a big fan of crossbows, which are also truly metal.</p>



<p>&#8220;And she deserves our complete and utter respect for this (and for raising three kids).&#8221;</p>



<p>But some followers weren&#8217;t impressed, with one warning: &#8220;These kids will need a lot of therapy if this turns out to be true. </p>



<p>&#8220;Plus get them some boxing or karate lessons so they don’t get their tails beat on a daily basis &#8211; but they probably will anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another slammed: &#8220;Dumbest s**t ever.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15541827" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664788043.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15541827" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>Slaying &#8217;em &#8211; Singer Tom Araya of the band Slayer[/caption]

<p>One person tweeted: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure that sounds &#8216;awesome&#8217; to the mom and her friends. </p>



<p>&#8220;I love the bands as well, however naming your children after them is just selfish and doing a massive disservice to the children.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t even imagine calling a child &#8216;Slayer&#8217; outside of a joke.&#8221;</p>



<p>However there were a few lighthearted comments too, with Joachim Hackshaw joking: &#8220;At least she didn’t name one of them Megadeath, he’d constantly be fighting with first child, Metallica.&#8221;</p>



<p>And a brutal David Wright replied: &#8220;So these are the expectations she has for her kids: the child named Metallica will be her most successful.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Child named Pantera will do fine, but die first.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Child named Slayer will do OK, but be less successful than the other two kids and less relevant.&#8221;</p>

<p>New Zealand babies are also banned from being called &#8216;Royal&#8217;, says Te Tari Taiwhenua, the country&#8217;s Department of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>It recently released the list of names banned in 2020 by the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages.</p>
<p>Roya Ltee, Royal, Royal-Blue, Royal-Reign, Royalty, Royalty-Rain, Royele-Blue, and Royell were among the 44 names rejected.</p>
<p>No newborn has been named Covid.</p>
<p>The Registrar-General, Jeff Montgomery, said he would &#8220;consider carefully any application on the grounds it could be deemed offensive to those who have lost loved ones to the disease&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added: “There&#8217;s no problem if you want to give your child a spelled-out number or even silly name, but remember your child has to live with it!”</p>
<p>Rejected names include: </p>
<p>Bishop; Caius-Major; Commodore (after the car); Constable; Dukes; Justice; King; Majesty-Faith; Major; Marley-King; Master; Messiah; Mistah; MyHonour; Nikita-Majesty; Prince; Princess; Prinz; Queen; Royal; Royal-Blue; Royell; Saint and Sovereign. </p>

<p>THE heartbroken parents of TikTok star Caitlyn Loane say they are searching for answers after she took her own life aged 19.</p>



<p>Richele and Phillip Loane said the teenage farmer had &#8220;a bright future&#8221; and there were no warning signs <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15535112/tiktok-star-caitlyn-loane-takes-her-own-life/">leading up to the tragedy</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrities/15536245/tiktok-star-caitlyn-loane-australia-death-suicide/">Caitlyn</a> was well known for sharing TikTok videos about life on her family&#8217;s 1,500-acre cattle farm in Tasmania, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australia</a>.</p>



<p>She died days after posting a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15535993/tiktok-star-caitlyn-loane-final-video/">haunting final clip</a> lip syncing to a country song with the lyrics: &#8220;How far would you drive for the girl of your dreams?&#8221;</p>



<p>Today her mum Richele said she is &#8220;still lost for words&#8221;.</p>



<p>She told Daily Mail Australia: &#8220;The are no answers for us, there&#8217;s no reasons, no whys.</p>



<p>&#8220;She had a crop in the ground. Her future was extremely bright.&#8221;</p>



<p>Richele said Caitlyn had been working on the farm &#8220;since she she was old enough to ride a four wheel bike, which was about eight&#8221;.</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;She was just an effervescent person, she loved run up to people and give them a big hug when she saw them.</p>



<p>&#8220;But she was wise beyond her years too. When she was 13 she wanted to be 18 and when she was 18 she wanted to be 25.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dad Phillip said: &#8220;She felt very strongly about the family farming history and I remember her saying recently, &#8216;Dad this is where I&#8217;m meant to be, it&#8217;s where I want to be&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing she did was just work to her. She was passionate, she&#8217;d get right into even the most mundane task on the farm, or judging juniors, which she loved doing.&#8221;</p>



<p>It also emerged today a fraudster is preying on Caitlyn&#8217;s friends and fans with a fake fundraising page.</p>



<p>Richele posted it on Facebook and warned people not to fall for the sick scam, which her pals called &#8220;beyond despicable&#8221;.</p>



<p>Caitlyn&#8217;s sudden death sparked an outpouring of grief from her thousands of fans online.</p>



<p>He dad Phillip earlier paid tribute to her in a local paper: &#8220;She was a lovely, crazy young woman who was an invaluable member of our family.&#8221;</p>

					EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.				</p>

			<div>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society &#8211; from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.</p>
<p>That is why <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youre-not-alone/">The Sun launched the You&#8217;re Not Alone campaign.</a></p>
<p>The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others&#8230; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7194521/the-sun-suicide-prevention-campaign-launch/">You&#8217;re Not Alone.</a></p>
<p>If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:</p>
<ul>
<li>CALM, <a href="http://www.thecalmzone.net/">www.thecalmzone.net</a>, 0800 585 858</li>
<li>Heads Together, <a href="https://www.headstogether.org.uk/support/">www.headstogether.org.uk </a></li>
<li>Mind, <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">www.mind.org.uk</a>, 0300 123 3393</li>
<li>Papyrus,<a href="https://www.papyrus-uk.org/"> www.papyrus-uk.org</a>, 0800 068 41 41</li>
<li>Samaritans, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">www.samaritans.org</a>, 116 123</li>
</ul>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>Mum Richele said the fourth-generation farmer &#8220;was so talented and she loved mentoring younger people&#8221;, adding she was an inspiration to all young female farmers around the world.</p>



<p>A school friend posted on Facebook: &#8220;Oh how my heart hurts to know you have left us all, the bright, bubbly, beautiful but crazy girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another pal said: &#8220;What a phenomenal young lady so many of us had the privilege to meet and share memories with. Rest easy Caitlyn Loane.&#8221;</p>



<p>In June, Caitlyn opened a farmer&#8217;s festival in Tasmania where she was involved in judging cattle.</p>

<p>THE former Haitian prime minister and the newly appointed PM are vying for control following President Jovenel Moïse&#8217;s assassination.</p>



<p>Claude Joseph, who recently resigned as PM, claimed he was in charge of the Caribbean country and declared martial law as the country descends into chaos.</p>

<p>Ariel Henry, who was appointed into the top job by the President last week but not formally sworn in, claims he&#8217;s the official office-holder.</p>



<p>The brazen killing has caused political unrest and a surge in gang violence and a growing humanitarian crisis in the poorest country in the Americas.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523311/meet-haitian-president-jovenel-moise-death-details-revealed/">Moïse</a>&nbsp;was allegedly killed by a group of foreign &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523333/cops-shoot-gunmen-president-haiti/">well-trained commandos</a>&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/15518391/who-assassinated-jovenel-moise/">posing as US drug enforcement agents</a>&nbsp;who stormed his presidential compound in Port-au-Prince.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-biden/">Biden</a> administration said Thursday that it recognised Joseph as Haiti&#8217;s acting prime minister.</p>



<p>&#8220;Claude Joseph was the incumbent in the position. He was serving as the acting prime minister before the assassination of President Moïse. We continue to work with Claude Joseph as such,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said.</p>



<p>White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the US was pushing for elections to happen later this year.</p>



<p>&#8220;We know that free and fair elections will facilitate a peaceful transition of power to a newly elected president and we certainly continue to support Haiti’s democratic institutions,&#8221; she told reporters on Thursday.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will call on all political parties, civil society and stakeholders to work together in the wake of the tragedy and echo the acting prime minister’s call for calm.&#8221;</p>



<p>Questions have been raised about Joseph&#8217;s legitimacy after Moïse&nbsp;appointed Henry as Prime Minister last week.</p>



<p>And to further complicate things the temporary president is supposed to be the nation&#8217;s Chief Justice, René Sylvestre &#8211; but he died last month of Covid.</p>



<p>With no one in charge &#8211; and various factions vying for power &#8211; the threat of mass civil unrest or potentially even civil war, hangs over Haiti.</p>



<p>This comes as Haitian police detained 17 suspects connected to Moïse&#8217;s brazen killing, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/us-news/3249068/haiti-james-solages-joseph-vincent-jovenel-moise-assassination/">including two US-Haitian dual-nationals</a>.</p>

Solages was one of two US-Haitians picked up by police in connection to the assassination[/caption]



<p>Miami residents James Solages, 35, and Joseph Vincent, 55, alongside 15&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/colombia/">Colombian</a>&nbsp;nationals &#8211; six of which are former army members &#8211; were arrested on Thursday. </p>



<p>Solages, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, describes himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida.</p>



<p>Haitian police chief Léon Charles said: “Foreigners came to our country to kill the president. We are going to bring them to justice.”</p>



<p>Three of the alleged suspects &#8211; all Colombian &#8211; were killed and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15530246/haitian-president-jovenel-moise-riddled-with-12-bullets/">eight reportedly remain on the run</a>.</p>



<p>Cars were set alight by furious locals after a firefight between cops and the suspected assassins.</p>



<p>Angry crowds gathered near a police station in Petion-Ville on Thursday and torched several vehicles they presumed were used by the alleged gunmen.</p>



<p>Smoke was seen billowing from cars that were set on fire across the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince.</p>



<p>Four more Colombian suspects were identified as Alejandro Girardo Zapata, 41; John Jairo Ramirez Gomez, 40; Victor Albeiro Pinera Cardona, 40; and Manuel Antonio Groso Guarin, 41.</p>

<p>Haitian officials have not released the names of the other men arrested.</p>



<p>Earlier, police had said seven of the assailants were dead but not explain the discrepancy.</p>



<p>Police are continuing the search for more suspects.</p>



<p>In February, opposition politicians nominated their own president in an effort to drive out Moise whose five-year term had expired.</p>



<p>Joseph Mécène Jean-Louis, 72, a judge, said that he accepted the nomination.</p>



<p>Moïse insisted his term in office ended in February 2022 &#8211; a claim accepted by the United States.</p>



<p>Videos show the worrying scenes as smoke rises of Port-au-Prince as gun battles rage amid the crackdown.</p>

<p>THe mystery behind the Swedish plane tragedy which killed nine may never be solved amid fears the aircraft &#8220;was not fitted with black box&#8221;, warns an expert.</p>



<p>The small propeller plane, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15537034/sweden-plane-crash-orebro-airport/">carrying eight skydivers and its pilot</a>, crashed shortly after 5pm GMT on Thursday, as it was taking off.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15543035" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664804599.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15543035" width="960" height="639" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>All nine people aboard the small aircraft used for skydiving have sadly died[/caption]



<p>Paramedics rushed to the scene of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/plane-crashes-air-disasters/">fatal smash</a> at Örebro Airport, about 160km (100miles) west of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sweden/">Stockholm</a>.</p>



<p>However, Swedish police later confirmed that all nine on board had tragically been killed.</p>



<p>The Dagens Nyheter newspaper identified the plane as a single-engine, propeller-driven De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver.</p>



<p>The Swedish Accident Investigation Authority has already sent a team to the the accident site to probe the crash.</p>



<p>But flight expert Christer Åström told <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/233KRq/flygexperten-planet-kan-sakna-svart-lada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftonbladet</a> that the plane might not have a black box to help the investigation.</p>



<p>He explained that there is no official requirement for this type of smaller plane &#8211; typically used for parachuting &#8211; to be fitted with a black box.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15538606" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664658659.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15538606" width="960" height="639" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>EPA</figcredit></figure>A small plane crashed outside Örebro in Sweden[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15538807" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664658757.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15538807" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>EPA</figcredit></figure>The plane crashed after takeoff at Örebro Airport[/caption]



<p>The expert said that, from an initial analysis, the crash could have happened because of the &#8220;plane&#8217;s centre of gravity&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;They did not make it more than a few hundred metres before the plane crashed.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a tragedy for the Parachuting Association, that within three years they&#8217;ve lost two aircraft and all these members. </p>



<p>&#8220;It is a terrible blow to the sport of skydiving, which is otherwise filled with rules and safety regulations.&#8221;</p>



<p>Åström was referring to a crash in Umeå two years ago, when all nine aboard another parachute plane perished when the aircraft broke into pieces midair, with the parts crashing on to the ground.</p>



<p>Aviation expert Hans Käll said he, too, believed that Thursday&#8217;s accident will be hard to investigate, as the De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver appeared to lack a black box.</p>



<p>Black boxes weigh about 4.5kg (10 pounds) and contain finger-nail sized recording chips on circuit boards.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15538827" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664658752.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15538827" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>EPA</figcredit></figure>Emergency services rushed to the scene of the crash[/caption]



<p>Local media said the plane caught fire after crashing, but the blaze was quickly extinguished.</p>



<p>Emergency services &#8211; including ten ambulances &#8211; rushed to the scene, according to reports.</p>



<p>Spokesperson Carl-Johan Linde of the Swedish Maritime Administration, which oversees air traffic, told broadcaster SVT the crash must have occurred in connection with the plane&#8217;s takeoff.</p>



<p>Rescue services found the aircraft alongside one of the runways, he added.</p>



<p>Initially, police had referred to &#8220;multiple&#8221; deaths and said that one person had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.</p>



<p>But they later confirmed that those killed included the pilot and eight parachutists.</p>



<p>Emil Gustavsson, rescue leader at the Joint Rescue Co-Ordination Centre,&nbsp;told local TT news agency: &#8220;It is a sky diver plane that has crashed after takeoff.&#8221;</p>



<p>Anna Oscarsson, head of communications for the Swedish Skydiving Association, said: &#8220;Normally, most skydiving is done on the weekends.</p>



<p>&#8220;But they had rented a plane to jump more intensely during the whole week.&#8221;</p>



<p>The cause of the accident is not yet known.</p>



<p>Police have scheduled a news conference for today.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15538818" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664656614.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15538818" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>EPA</figcredit></figure>The plane crashed at around 7.20pm today[/caption]



<p>Örebro is the sixth-largest city in Sweden, with about 124,000 inhabitants.</p>



<p>Sky diving courses regularly take place in the city during the summer months &#8211; with a popular parachute club based in Örebro.</p>



<p>The city&#8217;s airport is the fourth-largest cargo airport in Sweden.</p>

<p>THIS is the terrifying moment surfers at Bondi Beach were stalked by at least five huge sharks as boarders appeared totally oblivious to the lurking predators.</p>



<p>Lifeguards sounded the alarm at the world famous <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australian</a> beach shortly after 9am on Friday after being alerted by a news helicopter.</p>

<p>Dramatic footage from the chopper showed the creatures within metres of surfers at the popular <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sydney/">Sydney</a> spot, with a larger shark stalking one of the board riders.</p>



<p>The video showed dozens of surfers waiting to catch the next wave as sharks feast on a large school of nearby bait fish.</p>



<p>One person on a red board can be seen calmly paddling directly towards three sharks, before stopping to sit while the sharks loitered perilously close by.</p>



<p>ABC journalist Josh Bavas shared the terrifying footage on <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshBavas/status/1413280042449215494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, writing: &#8220;Um, did the news helicopter just film several SHARKS near surfers at Bondi Beach just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Surf Lifesaving jetskis were used to frighten the predators away and escort swimmers back to shore as the sharks circled, <a href="https://www.7news.com.au/news/sharks/bondi-beach-evacuated-on-friday-morning-after-news-helicopter-captures-sharks-near-surfers-c-3354696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7News</a> reports.</p>



<p>French-Vietnamese local surfer, Marco Ngoxuan, told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/sharks-spotted-lifeguards-hit-the-alarm-at-bondi-beach/news-story/6c4358aeadd4fe23681ed8aaa29bcc18">The Daily Telegraph</a>: &#8220;We were told there was a shark, and the helicopter was above looking for it.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was up to us if we wanted to stay in the water or just leave but we heard the alarm, so I think everybody just got the same feeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always part of the risk of going out in the water. They have drones and everything now to improve safety, so it&#8217;s better than nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some of the surfers weren&#8217;t deterred by the sharks and stayed in the water.</p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DD-KH-COMP-SHARK-graphic-v4-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=479" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15540823" width="479" height="960" />



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s their place, it&#8217;s where they live, so it&#8217;s me taking the risk,&#8221; one surfer told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-09/sharks-spotted-close-to-surfers-a-bondi-beach/100280306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The lifeguard is there with jet skis so I think it&#8217;s under control.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The species of the sharks was not immediately known.</p>



<p>It comes just days after a surfer was rushed to hospital after being savaged by a shark at a beach in Crescent Head, 250 miles north of Sydney.</p>



<p>Shocking <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15494233/surfer-savaged-shark-board-australia/">pictures from the scene show a huge chunk bitten</a> from the victim&#8217;s surfboard.</p>



<p>Lifeguards said the 20-year-old surfer was mauled at around 4.30pm local time on Monday.</p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SHARK-ATTACKS.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=704" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15540838" width="704" height="954" />



<p>He was treated at the scene for a severe arm injury before being flown to hospital by air ambulance, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/animals/man-attacked-by-shark-at-crescent-head-beach-on-nsw-mid-north-coast/news-story/ea4462d4b28b211cda28e811d520d097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">News.com.au</a> reports.</p>



<p>Crescent Head and Killick beaches &#8211; popular spots for water sports &#8211; were closed after the attack.</p>



<p>And it comes six weeks after a &#8220;hero&#8221; dad was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15000810/daughter-hero-surfer-shark-heart-ocean/">killed by a 15ft suspected great white shark</a> while surfing at nearby Tuncurry beach.</p>



<p>Mark Sanguinetti, 59, from Sydney, was mauled on the thigh after trying to warn his three pals of the danger.</p>

<p>Avenatti is a high-powered lawyer with a long career of securing big wins for his clients, and as such, it&#8217;s not terribly surprising that he&#8217;d be a multi-millionaire.</p>
<p>Avenatti, 50, was all but unknown until two years ago when he began representing porn star <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/stormy-daniels/">Stormy Daniels</a> in lawsuits against <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
<p>But criminal fraud charges on two coasts disrupted Avenatti’s rapid rise to fame.</p>
<p>He was found guilty in a fraud trial relating to an attempt to extort up to $25million from Nike and faces and a separate trial in 2022 in Manhattan, where he is charged with cheating <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9133420/stormy-daniels-lawyer-avenatti-ferrari-money/">Daniels out of hundreds of thousands of dollars</a>.</p>
<p>California prosecutors said Avenatti was enjoying a $200,000-a-month lifestyle while cheating clients out of millions of dollars and failing to pay hundreds of thousands to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>Charges alleging he cheated Daniels out of proceeds from a book deal followed weeks later.</p>
<p>Avenatti pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
<h2>Why has Michael Avenatti been jailed?</h2>
<p>Avenatti was convicted on charges that he tried to extort up to $25million from sportswear giant <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nike/" rel="">Nike</a> when he represented a Los Angeles youth basketball league organizer upset that the sport giant had ended its sponsorship.</p>
<p>In March 2019, he threatened to go public with evidence that the company had bribed amateur basketball players and their families unless he received a payout.</p>
<p>The celebrity lawyer, 50, was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10968082/stormy-daniels-disgraced-lawyer-michael-avenatti-is-found-guilty-of-trying-extort-nike-for-25-million/">found guilty on February 14</a>.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2021, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15537486/michael-avenatti-cries-sentenced-2-half-years/">Avenatti cried as he was sentenced</a> to two-and-a-half years in prison.</p>
<h2>What is Michael Avenatti&#8217;s net worth?</h2>
<p>How much Avenatti is precisely worth isn&#8217;t public knowledge.</p>
<p>A race car driver with expensive taste and a high-end lifestyle, Avenatti has been estimated to be worth about $20million, around £15.5million.</p>
<p>He has won more than $1billion in judgements for clients in high profile cases, with the biggest win for Avenatti the $454million (£355million) 2017 fraud verdict against Kimberly-Clark’s company Halyard Health.</p>
<p>Avenatti reportedly owned a $12.6million (£10m) house in Laguna Beach, California, which he sold in 2015, according to real estate website Virtual Globetrotting.</p>
<h2>When did Michael Avenatti represent Stormy Daniels?</h2>
<p>Avenatti represented porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against President Donald Trump, making hundreds of television appearances.</p>
<p>Stormy, the pornographic film producer, director and actor, was at the centre of a high-profile scandal in which she claims to have had sex with Trump and paid $130,000 in hush money over it during the 2016 election.</p>
<div class="advert-wrapper advert-wrapper--articlempu">
<div id="articlempu" class="dfp-ad advert--inarticle">
<p>Daniels, however, sued Trump in 2018 to be released from the agreement after his election.</p>
<p>The suit was dismissed when it was determined the NDA was not enforceable.</p>
<p>Trump and his administration <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/6/18253467/trump-michael-cohen-checks-legal-stormy-daniels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied Trump personally knew about the hush money</a> until the president<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/991992302267785216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ultimately admitted he paid Cohen</a> for the Daniels payment, <a href="https://apnews.com/2c3e23ae71c4f99aee1ba9403334bdb9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Associated Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>His lawyers argued that Daniels didn’t sufficiently prove the president’s involvement in the deal.</p>
<p>However, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert B. Broadbelt ruled that sufficient evidence showed both parties made the non-disclosure agreement under pseudonyms, “David Dennison” for Donald Trump and “Peggy Peterson” for Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>RAPPER Lil Baby was detained in Paris on July 8 for allegedly transporting drugs, according to the city prosecutor’s office.</p>



<p>NBA star James Harden <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3246696/lil-baby-arrested-drugs-paris-james-harden/">was also stopped but not detained</a>.</p>



<p><strong><em>Read our <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3246831/lil-baby-james-harden-arrested-drugs-paris-live-news/">Lil Baby live blog</a> for the very latest news and updates&#8230;</em></strong></p>

<h2>Is weed legal in Paris?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/3246807/lil-baby-detained-paris-nba-star-james-harden/">Lil Baby</a> was one of three people arrested on weed-related charges in Paris.</p>



<p>About 20 grams of weed was seized by authorities. The substance is illegal in France.</p>



<p>Harden was not arrested or taken into custody, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1413209785948835841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESPN</a>.</p>



<p>The prosecutor&#8217;s office said that an investigation has been opened by the city&#8217;s 8th district police precinct.</p>



<p>Footage from the scene showed Harden and one other male being surrounded by cops and having their pockets searched.</p>



<p>Harden can be heard telling someone &#8220;it&#8217;s ok, I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>One photo, obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/07/08/lil-baby-arrested-james-harden-detained-weed-paris-fashion-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, showed an officer holding what appears to be a vaping device. </p>



<p>It is unclear who it belongs to and what substance is inside.</p>

<p>And just hours later, Swedish police confirmed nine passengers had been killed.</p>



<p>They said: &#8220;A total of nine people died in the accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emil Gustavsson, rescue leader at the Joint Rescue Co-Ordination Centre,&nbsp;told local TT news agency: &#8220;It is a sky diver plane that has crashed after takeoff.&#8221;</p>



<p>Local media said the plane caught fire after crashing, but the blaze was quickly extinguished.</p>

<p>Rescue services located the aircraft alongside one of the runways, Carl-Johan Linde, spokesman for the Swedish Maritime Authority said.</p>

<p>In 2019, a tourist plane carrying nine people <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9504836/sweden-plane-crash-nine-dead-skydivers/">crashed into a Swedish river</a>, killing all passengers.</p>



<p>Horrified eyewitnesses told how they heard a loud &#8220;bang&#8221; before the plane plunged into a river outside Umea during a skydiving trip.</p>



<p>Authorities said the passengers were skydivers and some witnesses told Swedish media they saw parachutists trying to jump off the plane just before the crash.</p>

<p>LOWLY cow! This tiny beast is believed to be the shortest in the world at just 20in.</p>



<p>Tens of thousands of people have breached strict lockdown rules and herded in to see him in a village near Bangladesh capital Dhaka.</p>

<p>Rani, a Bhutanese breed farmed for its meat, suffers from dwarfism and is 20in tall and 26in long.</p>

<p>Regional chief vet Sajedul Islam believes Rani’s condition is down to genetic inbreeding and believes it will not grow any bigger.</p>



<p>Guinness World Records have reportedly promised a decision within 90 days.</p>

<p><strong>A DUTCH rapper allegedly shot a crime journalist five times, leaving the justice campaigner fighting for his life.</strong></p>



<p>Delano Geerman &#8211; known as &#8220;Slick&#8221; or &#8220;Demper&#8221; &#8211; could be charged with the shooting of Peter R. de Vries that happened in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/amsterdam/">Amsterdam</a> at about 7.30pm on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old journalist was allegedly attacked after making a television appearance and is now in hospital in critical condition.</p>



<p>Mr De Vries &#8211; who is famous in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/netherlands/">Netherlands</a> for exposing notorious criminals and speaking on behalf of crime victims&nbsp;&#8211; was shot in his head and body, witnesses told local media.</p>



<p>The 21-year-old rapper was stopped in a car on a motorway and the driver, named locally as Kamiel Egiert, 35, was also arrested, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/f5986184-dffa-11eb-ab4e-c25eb6444929?shareToken=8e77fc2f958ecb80aea3e18a5fbda4f5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">The Times</a> reports.</p>



<p>A third suspect had also been arrested, but has since been released, according to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/7/peter-r-de-vries-fighting-for-his-life-after-amsterdam-shooting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Al Jazeera</a>.</p>



<p>This evening, while investigations are ongoing, police raided the rapper&#8217;s house in the town of Tiel.</p>



<p>Geerman &#8211; who has a YouTube channel accused of glorifying violence &#8211; is said to have a criminal record.</p>



<p>The car&#8217;s driver, Egiert, has an outstanding European arrest warrant for theft and robberies which was previously issued by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/poland/">Poland</a>.</p>



<p>Officers are allegedly investigating the men&#8217;s links to Ridouan Taghi, a Moroccan-Dutch involved in organised crime.</p>



<p>According to police, Taghi made death threats against De Vries in 2019 after the journalist supported the main witness against him.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15537755" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000548385947.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15537755" width="960" height="707" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Collect</figcredit></figure>Police are investigating the links between the suspects and Ridouan Taghi[/caption]



<p>At the time of the shooting, Mr De Vries was acting as a spokesperson and non-legal advisor for witness Nabil B. who is testifying against Taghi, the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/anger-and-tears-over-shooting-of-dutch-crime-reporter-peter-r-de-vries/a-58194028" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Deutsche Welle</a> reports.</p>



<p>Nabil B.&#8217;s brother was murdered in broad daylight in Amsterdam&nbsp;in 2018 and his lawyer Derk Wiersum was gunned down outside his home in 2019.</p>



<p>They were allegedly murdered by Taghi&#8217;s associates.</p>



<p>Dutch newspaper <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/431483609/verdachte-aanslag-de-vries-blijkt-neef-van-kopstuk-moordbende-taghi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">De Telegraaf</a> reports that Geerman is a first cousin of Jaouad Joey W, the main suspect in a previous criminal investigation known as the 26Koper case.</p>



<p>Following the shooting on Tuesday, De Vries&#8217;s son Royce tweeted: &#8220;Yesterday our worst nightmare became reality. We as a family surround Peter with love and hope during this difficult phase. </p>



<p>&#8220;Much is still uncertain, but what is certain is that all expressions of support from all over the country now offer enormous support.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the attack was &#8220;shocking and inconceivable&#8221;.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;It’s an attack on a courageous journalist and by extension an attack on the freedom of the press, which is so essential for our democracy and rule of law.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said: &#8220;Peter R de Vries is for all of us a national hero, an unusually courageous journalist, tirelessly seeking justice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today, justice in our country appears a long way off. A brutal, cowardly crime has been committed.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists called on authorities to investigate the circumstances of the shooting to determine whether Mr De Vries was targeted for his work.</p>



<p>European Council President Charles Michel said yesterday: &#8220;A crime has been committed against a journalist. It is a crime against our fundamental value of freedom of the press.&#8221;</p>

<p>The incident has stunned the Netherlands as gun violence is rare in the country, but killings linked to organised crime are not uncommon.</p>

<p><strong>A BRITISH man has died after hitting his head as he jumped into a friend’s pool on the Costa Blanca in Spain.</strong></p>



<p>Paramedics tried to revive the 64-year-old after he knocked himself out, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15537904" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1c846b34-f82e-4b75-8c56-51b5fbfeb03d.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15537904" width="960" height="629" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Solarpix</figcredit></figure>A British man has died after jumping into a pool in Spain[/caption]

<p>Police launched an investigation into the tragedy, which happened today at around 5.45pm on a residential estate in Benissa, near the holiday resort of Calpe, north of Benidorm.</p>



<p>It is not yet clear if the man was on holiday in the area or a resident, although sources said he was visiting a friend.</p>



<p>The man is believed to have hit his head on the bottom of the pool, which is thought to be just over three feet deep.</p>



<p>Civil Guard officers are still at the scene and the body has yet to be removed on the orders of a local investigating judge.</p>



<p>A spokesman for a regional government-run emergency services coordination centre said: “The alarm was raised just before 5.45pm this evening.</p>



<p>“The message received was that a man was unconscious after jumping into a shallow pool on a residential estate in Benissa and hitting his head on the bottom.</p>



<p>“An ambulance was mobilised. Local police officers tried to revive the man using CPR before medical responders arrived to discover he still had no pulse.</p>



<p>“He was confirmed dead at the scene.”</p>

<p>Sources close to the case confirmed the dead man was a 64-year-old Brit who had been visiting a friend, although they were not able to say if he was on holiday or lived in the area.</p>



<p>He has not yet been named.</p>



<p>A post-mortem will now attempt to determine the cause of death, which is thought to be linked to the blow he received to his head.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15537734" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000614106152.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15537734" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>There are many complex differences between nations with a republic and a democratic government[/caption]



<h2>What is the difference between a republic and a democracy?</h2>



<p>A Democracy is defined as a type of government where the power to govern rests with a country&#8217;s people rather than a ruling family or a single individual.</p>



<p>This means that citizens control how their government operates, usually through voting.</p>



<p>Typically through a constitution, democracies limit the powers of their top rulers, such as the president of the <a href="http://the-sun.com/where/united-states/">United States</a>, set up a system of&nbsp;separation of powers&nbsp;and responsibilities between branches of the government, and protect the&nbsp;people&#8217;s natural rights&nbsp;and&nbsp;civil liberties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, a republic is a government system where the power rests with a nation&#8217;s citizens.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15537737" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664374663.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15537737" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>In a country with a democratic government, citizens control how their government operates, usually through voting[/caption]



<p>In a republic, the people elect representatives&nbsp;to make the laws and an executive to enforce those laws.</p>



<p>While the majority still rules in selecting representatives, an official charter lists and protects certain&nbsp;inalienable rights, thus protecting the minority from the arbitrary political whims of the majority.</p>



<p>Citizens and their representatives are to work cooperatively to promote the common good rather than their own interests.</p>



<h2>What countries have a Republic government?</h2>



<p>During the 21 century, there are many countries in the world with republic governments, although their types of republics differ.</p>



<p>Some countries that with a republic government include:</p>



<ul><li>Afghanistan</li><li>Albania</li><li>Argentina</li><li>Brazil</li><li>Chile</li><li>Colombia</li><li>Costa Rica</li><li>Croatia</li><li>Guatemala</li><li>Haiti</li><li>Maldives</li><li>Iraq</li><li>Israel</li><li>Italy</li><li>Latvia</li><li>Mexico</li><li>Philippines</li><li>Poland</li><li>Slovenia</li><li>Turkey</li><li>Uganda</li><li>Uzbekistan</li></ul>

<h2>What countries have a democratic government?</h2>



<p>The nations with a democratic government include:</p>



<ul><li>Norway</li><li>Iceland</li><li>Sweden</li><li>New Zealand</li><li>Finland</li><li>Ireland</li><li>Canada</li><li>Denmark</li><li>Australia</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Netherlands</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>France</li><li>United States</li></ul>



<h2>What type of governments do citizens in Russia and North Korea live under?</h2>



<p><a href="https://the-sun.com/where/russia/">Russia</a> and <a href="https://the-sun.com/where/north-korea/">North Korea</a> are two non-democratic republic countries.</p>



<p>According to the Russian Consitution, the nation&#8217;s government is set up like a republic, but many argue that the country is operated more like a dictatorship under President <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/who/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15537740" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663397891-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15537740" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Many view the nations of Russia and North Korea as being ruled under a dictatorship, not a democracy or republic as their constitution claims[/caption]

<p>Although the president and other government officials are elected by popular vote, the Russian government also limits Russian citizens&#8217; freedom, including&nbsp;suppressing free speech&nbsp;and&nbsp;controlling access to objective information.</p>



<p>North Korea&#8217;s government is set up much like the US, split into three branches: the executive branch, judicial branch and the legislative branch.</p>



<p>However, many classify North Korea as being ruled under a dictatorship under President <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/who/kim-jong-un/">Kim Jong-Un</a>.</p>

<p>WORLD War Three fears are growing after Russian nuclear submarines were spotted sailing through the Baltic Sea as the US takes part in war games in the Black Sea.</p>



<p>Three <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian</a> nuclear submarines are sailing through the Baltic Sea for the first time in a &#8220;show of strength&#8221; as the Americans take part in drills alongside <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">NATO</a> forces in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>A Russian Oscar-II Class nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine was spotted entering the Baltic Sea on Monday, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/07/08/russia-shows-nuclear-submarine-firepower-black-sea-skirmishes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a> reports.</p>



<p>It passed under the Great Belt Bridge, which spans the entrance to the Baltic, at about 8.50am local time.</p>



<p>And two other nuclear-powered submarines were also seen.</p>



<p>At the same time, US commanders said naval ship Yuma has &#8220;transited into the Black Sea to operate with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2194667/nato-defence-spending-country-article-50-cost/">NATO</a> allies and partners&#8221; until July 10.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/528700-assault-ship-tensions-escalating/">RT</a>, the US ship will take part in &#8220;Sea Breeze&#8221; exercises with 32 nations, including Ukraine, the UK, France, Poland, Georgia, Senegal, South Korea, Pakistan, Japan and Morocco.</p>



<p>US military chiefs said the drills will include &#8220;multiple warfare areas including amphibious warfare, land maneuver warfare, diving operations, maritime interdiction operations, air defense, special operations integration, anti-submarine warfare, and search and rescue operations&#8221;.</p>



<p>As both countries wander the oceans, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/moscow/">Moscow</a> said the war games in the Black Sea pose a real risk for potential escalations in military tensions, according to reports.</p>

<p>The Russian submarines in the Baltic Sea are set to attend a naval event in St Petersburg on July 25.</p>



<p>HI Sutton, a defence analyst, told The Telegraph: &#8220;Russia has been sending nuclear submarines to the naval parade in St Petersburg for several years, but this is the first time three submarines have been sent.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are the only nuclear submarines in the Baltic. These deployments act as a show of strength for both home and foreign audiences. </p>



<p>&#8220;NATO and unaligned Baltic States will likely keep a careful eye on this submarine.&#8221;</p>



<h2>FARCICAL FACE-OFF</h2>



<p>It comes just two weeks after a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15369390/russia-uk-fires-warning-navy-ship-black-sea/">Russian coastguard boat barked &#8220;change your course or I’ll fire&#8221; at a massive Brit warship</a> during a farcical face-off in the Black Sea.</p>



<p>HMS Defender was off Crimea in international waters when the 8,500-ton ship &#8211; armed to the teeth with hi-tech weapons systems &#8211; was confronted by the smaller vessel bellowing out its demands.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russian </a>warplanes were then called up join in and buzzed the Type-45 destroyer with four bombs dropped onto its path.</p>



<p>The BBC reported that more than 20 aircraft were overhead the HMS Defender with two Russian coastguard boats just 100m away at times.</p>



<p>The Russian vessel opened fire twice &#8211; once at 12.06pm and again at 12.08pm &#8211; before the planes were ordered in.</p>



<p>And in a sign of rising tensions, Russia deployed fighter jets over the Black Sea on Wednesday after a US spy plane was spotted.</p>

<p>Russia claims two Su-30 fighters prevented a Boeing P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine patrol aircraft of the US Navy from entering its airspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A video was released showing the aerial standoff, but the precise location was not disclosed.</p>



<p>&#8220;On the evening of July 6, Russian airspace control devices over the neutral waters of the Black Sea detected an air target approaching the state border of the Russian Federation,&#8221; the defence ministry in Moscow said on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A MUM and a dad have both been diagnosed with cancer within months of each other as they bring up their three children.</strong></p>



<p>Kirsten Rasmussen had just given birth to baby Estelle in August last year when she was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer after discovering a lump.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15537076" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 700px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664634815-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=690" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15537076" width="690" height="380" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>GoFundMe</figcredit></figure>Kirsten and Pete Rasmussen with their three children, Will, Tommy and baby Estelle[/caption]



<p>The diagnosis sent her family life into turmoil, but she remained strong and did her best to battle the disease.</p>



<p>She underwent an 11-hour surgery for the removal of approximately 10 tumours, as well as a mastectomy, breast reconstruction and chemotherapy.</p>



<p>Kirsten &#8211; who is also mum to Will, six, Tommy, four &#8211; then had radiation therapy and, even though her outlook is now positive, she still has to undergo several surgeries.</p>



<p>But two weeks after the mum &#8211; an early childhood teacher &#8211; finished her radiation therapy, the unthinkable happened as her husband Pete was rushed to hospital after suffering multiple seizures.</p>



<p>The man, from Hobart, Tasmania, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australia</a>, had supported his wife after her diagnosis and had been strong to protect his family.</p>



<p>When Pete, 35, was rushed to hospital, he underwent an MRI and was sadly diagnosed with a grade 2 Astrocytoma cancerous brain tumour. </p>



<p>It is a type of invasive tumour, meaning there is no clear separation from the surrounding brain, according to the <a href="https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Astrocytoma-Tumors">American Association of Neurological Surgeons</a>.</p>



<p>The dad-of-three has been given between seven and ten years to live as doctors gave the family the heartbreaking news that the tumour is not curable by surgery.</p>



<p>Pete, who works as a teacher, told the <a href="https://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/tragic-double-blow-for-young-hobart-family-as-both-parents-battle-heartbreaking-diagnoses/news-story/06e0d61e97b6652b20627758edb70df5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Hobart Mercury</a>: &#8220;The tumour was in such a position that it was inoperable and if it was to be operated on I could become deaf, unable to speak or may or may not be conscious.</p>



<p>&#8220;The doctor said I would be the definition of a living vegetable.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15537090" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 492px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664634817-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=482" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15537090" width="482" height="270" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>GoFundMe</figcredit></figure>Family friends launched a fundraiser to help the family[/caption]



<p>Following their diagnosis, the two parents have been left unable to work and some friends decided to create a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-double-blow-that-no-young-family-can-stand" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe page</a> to help them with their expenses.</p>



<p>So far, more than $84,000 (£45,343) has been raised of a $200,000 (£107,960) goal.</p>



<p>The fundraiser reads: &#8220;Kirsten, Pete and their family now face great uncertainty and need our help to navigate the coming months and years ahead. </p>



<p>&#8220;Any donation will allow the family to recover at home, contribute to their medical bills and allow the children to continue to grow without the certainty of their parents&#8217; financial income.&#8221;</p>



<p>It adds: &#8220;As Pete himself has said, one of the most challenging parts of this story is that they have had is to tell their young children that a second of their parents is about to undergo an unbeatable cancer journey.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kirsten and Pete, who have been together for more than 15 years, have been described as active members of the Old Beach community, where they have lived in the past six years.</p>

<p>TWO foreign &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; suspected of assassinating Haiti President Jovenel Moïse were paraded by gun cops in the back of a truck today as a US citizen was reportedly arrested.</p>



<p>Dramatic footage shows security forces detaining two more of the men suspected of the brutal killing Moïse at his family home in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>

<p>The men, pictured holding hands and wearing clothes covered in dust, were taken to a police station in Petion-Ville, Port-au-Prince, <a href="https://haitiantimes.com/2021/07/08/residents-seize-two-more-suspects-of-haiti-president-moises-assassination/">Haiti Times</a> reports.</p>



<p>The footage, published by multiple Haitian media outlets, shows jeering crowds lining the streets as the two men were escorted by three gun cops.</p>



<p>A dozen men on motorbikes with cameras were pictured following the truck and the police station in the capital was surrounded by an angry mob.</p>



<p>&#8220;The special units are trying to protect the police station, because the population is very mad and is trying to get to them, to burn them,&#8221; Mathias Pierre, Haiti’s minister of elections, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fworld%2f2021%2f07%2f08%2fhaiti-president-assassinated%2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re trying to avoid that.&#8221;</p>



<p>James Solages, a US citizen, is among six people arrested so far over Moïse’s killing, Pierre said.</p>



<p>At least one other suspect is also believed to be a Haitian American.</p>



<p>Cops <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523333/cops-shoot-gunmen-president-haiti/">gunned down four suspects</a> in a fierce gun battle after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15530246/haitian-president-jovenel-moise-riddled-with-12-bullets/">Moïse was &#8220;riddled with 12 bullets&#8221; during the armed assault</a> on his home at 1am local time, officials said.</p>



<p>The former head of state was found laying on his back with 12 large wounds and one eye &#8220;gouged out&#8221;, magistrate Carl Henry Destin told local media.</p>

<p>Destin said a maid and a boy on duty were tied up by a group of armed commandos who shouted &#8220;DEA operation&#8221; as they entered the property.</p>



<p>The gunmen, who Haitian officials claim are &#8220;foreign mercenaries&#8221; who spoke a mix of Spanish and English with an American accent, ransacked the president&#8217;s office and bedroom.</p>



<p>Moïse&#8217;s daughter, Jomarlie, survived by hiding in her brother&#8217;s room.</p>



<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href="https://lenouvelliste.com/article/230281/le-president-jovenel-moise-a-ete-crible-de-balles-selon-les-minutes-du-constat-legal">Haitian media</a>, Destin said the president was found &#8220;lying on his back, with blue pants, a white shirt stained with blood, his mouth open, his left eye gouged out&#8221; and with &#8220;twelve orifices&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We saw a bullet impact at the level of his forehead, one in each nipple, three at the hip, one in the abdomen,&#8221; he added, stressing the bullet holes were made by a &#8220;large caliber weapon and with 9 mm projectiles”.</p>



<p>Police chief Leon Charles said his men &#8220;blocked&#8221; the group from leaving Moïse&#8217;s compound and have been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523333/cops-shoot-gunmen-president-haiti/">&#8220;battling&#8221; them</a>&nbsp;ever since.</p>

<p>Interim Prime Minister Clause Joseph has declared a two-week &#8220;stage of siege&#8221;, imposing martial law, which has seen the Caribbean nation&#8217;s borders sealed and all flights out of Port-au-Prince halted.</p>



<p>Another official called the assassins &#8220;well trained professional commandos&#8221; and &#8220;foreign mercenaries&#8221; who carried high-powered guns and dressed in black,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/explainer-assassination-threatens-more-chaos-for-haiti">Fox News</a>&nbsp;reports.</p>



<p>Video footage from the capital on Wednesday showed smoke billowing from several areas and sounds of gunfire.</p>



<p>And footage emerged appearing to show gunmen posed as DEA agents storming the politician&#8217;s home before he was shot dead in front of his terrified wife.</p>



<p>The dramatic footage shows a series of cars rolling towards Moïse&#8217;s house as other armed gang members follow on foot.</p>



<p>Just moments later he&nbsp;was gunned down&nbsp;in what has been branded a &#8220;hateful, inhumane and barbaric act&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>THOUSANDS of medieval Islamic tombs have been spotted forming hard to detect &#8216;galactic&#8217; patterns, according to new research.</strong></p>



<p>The tombs are located on a rocky mound in the Kassala region of eastern Sudan.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15536040" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 512px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664620291.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=502" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15536040" width="502" height="416" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Stefano Costanzo,CC-BY 4.0</figcredit></figure>The tombs are highlighted here in green[/caption]



<p>Archaeologists used satellite imagery and a method called cosmology to try and make sense of their layout.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s over 10,000 of the funerary monuments.</p>



<p>Stefano Costanzo from the University of Naples L&#8217;Orientale in Italy told <a href="https://www.livescience.com/medieval-islamic-tombs-hidden-pattern-cosmology.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Live Science</a>: &#8220;To the naked eye, it was clear that the clustered tombs were conditioned by the environment, but deeper meaning may have been implied in their spatial arrangement.&#8221;</p>



<p>His team used a method called the Neyman-Scott cluster process to detect a pattern in the tombs </p>



<figure id="attachment_15536051" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 526px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664620289.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=516" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15536051" width="516" height="411" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Stefano Costanzo,CC-BY 4.0</figcredit></figure>To the naked eye the mound just looks like this[/caption]



<p>This method was originally created to study patterns in stars and galaxies.</p>



<p>Costanzo&#8217;s team think they&#8217;re the first archaeologists to use this technique.</p>



<p>He told Live Science: &#8220;The biggest feature of this model lies in the fact that it can deal with archaeological data sets that [lack excavation data and historical records] but are composed of a very large number of elements, which is the basis to meaningful statistical analyses.&#8221;</p>



<p>The technique helped the scientists find subclusters of tombs that would stem off from &#8216;parent&#8217; tombs.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15536053" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664620290.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15536053" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Stefano Costanzo,CC-BY 4.0</figcredit></figure>The medieval tombs are in Sudan&#8217;s Kassala region[/caption]



<p>Few of the tombs have actually been excavated but this research could help archaeologists know where to look.</p>



<p>The researchers wrote in a paper published in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PLOS One</a>: &#8220;The local clusters are most probably tribal/family cemeteries of the Beja people.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Kassala region of eastern Sudan is still inhabited by some Beja people today who live a bit like nomads, meaning they travel and don&#8217;t have one permanent home.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s thought some of the tombs are from vastly different time periods.</p>



<p>Much more research is needed to determine who was buried there and the reasons behind the layout of the site.</p>

<p>A SICK paedophile who raped an eight week old baby and two toddlers has been jailed for 30 years. </p>



<p>Despite his heinous crime, his wife continues to visit him every week. </p>



<figure id="attachment_15535804" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 565px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664618610.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=555" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15535804" width="555" height="684" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Facebook</figcredit></figure>A paedophile has been jailed for 30 years[/caption]



<p>Sydney tradesman Bryan Michael Grange, 38, has been sentenced by a judge who branded his actions as &#8221;shocking and depraved in the extreme&#8221;.</p>



<p>Horrific details of the abuse he inflicted on three children between 2014 and 2018 were revealed &nbsp;in the NSW Downing District Court on Thursday. </p>



<p>Grange will remain in prison at least until 2044 after after Judge Kara Shead sentenced him to 30 years for child sexual abuse and &nbsp;four and a half years for possessing child abuse material.</p>



<p>One of his victims was an eight-week-old baby who he abused while the baby&#8217;s mum and his wife were outside, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/courts-law/pedophile-tradie-bryan-michael-grange-jailed-for-30-years-over-depraved-child-sexual-abuse/news-story/351937d65a05e3cef1913966b3805fc4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news.com.au</a> reports.</p>



<p>He later told a psychiatrist: &#8221;I had Viagra that morning. It was a pretty f..ked up time. I have no excuse for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another victim was a toddler, aged one or two who Grange abused after accompanying her to a public toilet while he repeatedly molested a third girl over a number of years until she was five years old.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15535830" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 636px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664618612.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=626" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15535830" width="626" height="452" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Facebook</figcredit></figure>Bryan Michael Grange abused three children including an eight week old baby[/caption]



<p>Grange also filmed a number of sickening videos of him molesting the girls. </p>



<p>According to the outlet, the girls were known to Grange and his abuse was a severe breach of trust, both for the girls and their parents, the court heard.</p>



<p>Additionally Grange had stored more than 30,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse including restrained children and forced into bestiality.</p>



<p>The court heard Grange used his personal account&nbsp;to sign up to a subscription website and spent over $7,000 on child abuse material.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Shead stated Grange had expressed some remorse to a psychiatrist but said he believed his victims &#8221;wouldn&#8217;t remember&#8221; his actions.</p>

<p>A MUCH-LOVED TikTok star has tragically taken her life days after posting a haunting final video.</p>



<p>Caitlyn Loane, 19, was well known for sharing videos about life on her family&#8217;s 600-hectare cattle farm in Tasmania, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australia</a>.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15535917" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 274px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5a87a880-7d92-442b-9c7d-8b0376d233d5.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=264" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15535917" width="264" height="460" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Her parents described her as a &#8216;lovely, crazy young woman&#8217;</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>The young Aussie, who has 51,000 followers, shared an eerie post on June 27 involving a montage of photos and her lip syncing to an American country tune with the lyrics &#8220;how far would you drive for the girl of your dreams?&#8221;</p>



<p>The video&#8217;s caption read: &#8220;What about Tasmania?&#8221;</p>



<p>So far, 160,000 people have watched the clip while countless others have left comments expressing their shock at the star&#8217;s abrupt death.</p>



<p>Dad Phillip Loane said his family was devastated by her passing.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was a lovely, crazy young woman who was an invaluable member of our family,&#8221; he told <a href="https://www.themercury.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TMWEB_WRE170_a_NEW&amp;dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.themercury.com.au%2Fnews%2Ftasmania%2Feveryday-should-be-r-u-ok-day-tributes-flow-for-young-north-west-farmer%2Fnews-story%2F6c65d9c6ca6a648043fb15511f6d9e13&amp;memtype=anonymous&amp;mode=premium">The Mercury</a>.</p>



<p>Mum Richele said her daughter&#8217;s smile &#8220;lit up the room&#8221;.</p>



<p>She said the fourth-generation farmer &#8220;was so talented and she loved mentoring younger people&#8221;, adding she was an inspiration to all young female farmers around the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t afraid to get her hands dirty &#8211; in some photos she has mud up to her knees,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>One of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15534297/caitlyn-loane-dead-suicide-tiktok-video-latest-updates/">Caitlyn</a>&#8216;s school friends posted on Facebook: &#8220;Oh how my heart hurts to know you have left us all, the bright, bubbly, beautiful but crazy girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will never ever forget the fond moments and memories we have together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What a phenomenal young lady so many of us had the privilege to meet and share memories with. Rest easy Caitlyn Loane,&#8221; another heartbroken user wrote.</p>



<p>She was described as a “very special girl” who was “loved by many and made so many people smile” in another post by a friend.</p>



<p>“You will be truly missed and some things will never be the same again, but you will remain forever young,” it read.</p>



<p>Caitlyn&#8217;s Aussie Rules club also shared its dismay in an statement on its Facebook page.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is with deep sadness and regret that the Devonport Football Club acknowledges the sudden passing of one of our female players, Caitlyn Loane,&#8221; the post read.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Board, the members, players, volunteers, sponsors, and supporters of the Devonport Football Club convey our sincere condolences and warmest thoughts to Caitlyn’s family and friends, which, of course, includes her teammates in the DFC Senior Women’s team.&#8221;</p>

<p>THE shocking injuries of Haiti First Lady Martine Moise have been revealed as it emerged that the president&#8217;s eye was gouged out during possible torture in the fatal attack. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3238379/moment-gunmen-storm-president-home/">President Moïse</a>, 53, was assassinated in his own home in Port Au-Prince in the early hours of Wednesday morning. </p>

<p>Haiti&#8217;s First Lady survived the attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. </p>



<p>The First Lady allegedly suffered from gunshot wounds to her arms and thigh, with a severe injury to her hand and abdomen, <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/07/first-lady-of-haiti-martine-moise-arrives-in-south-florida-for-treatment-after-being-shot-multiple-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Local 10</a> reported.</p>



<p>The First Lady was pictured being taken from a small plane on a stretcher at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport at around 3.30pm yesterday, before being transferred to Miami Baptist Hospital.</p>



<p>She was flown to the US by Trinity Air Ambulance and is said to be in a stable but critical condition.</p>



<p>Four men suspected of murdering the country&#8217;s president were reportedly <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3238379/moment-gunmen-storm-president-home/">shot dead by Haiti police</a>. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, authorities captured two more men in a hostage-taking situation, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/07/1014022342/4-suspected-killers-of-president-jovenel-moise-have-been-slain-2-arrested?utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;t=1625709364111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR</a>.</p>

<p>The suspects were dubbed &#8220;presumed assassins&#8221; of President Jovenel Moïse.</p>



<p>The former head of state was found<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3243131/haitian-president-jovenel-moise-riddled-with-12-bullets/"> laying on his back with 12 large wounds</a> and one eye &#8220;gouged out&#8221;, local magistrate Carl Henry Destin told&nbsp;<a href="https://lenouvelliste.com/article/230281/le-president-jovenel-moise-a-ete-crible-de-balles-selon-les-minutes-du-constat-legal">Nouvelliste</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking with Haitian media, Destin said the President was found &#8220;lying on his back, [with] blue pants, a white shirt stained with blood, his mouth open, his left eye gouged out&#8221; and with &#8220;twelve orifices&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We saw a bullet impact at the level of his forehead, one in each nipple, three at the hip, one in the abdomen &#8220;, he added, stressing the bullet holes were made by a &#8220;large caliber weapon and with 9 mm projectiles”.</p>



<p>&#8220;Many 5.56 and 7.62 mm cartridge cases were found between the gatehouse and the interior of the residence,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>The assassination of Moïse comes at a time when the Caribbean country has been overwhelmed by growing gang violence, rising costs of living, and unrest over the country&#8217;s authoritarian leadership. </p>



<p>Haiti&#8217;s communication secretary Frantz Exantus confirmed the arrests, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/haiti-president-jovenel-moise-killed-b56a0f8fec0832028bdc51e8d59c6af2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Associated Press reported.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3237291/us-could-send-troops-haiti/">The assassination of the Haitian president</a> was part of a “highly coordinated attack by a highly trained and heavily armed group,&#8221; Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said in a statement. </p>



<p>He has vowed to bring those responsible to justice.</p>



<p>Martial law has been declared throughout the country after Joseph issued an emergency order declaring a &#8220;state of siege,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article252616688.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami Herald</a>. </p>



<p>Moïse&#8217;s home was reportedly attacked at around 1am Wednesday by an armed group who claimed to be agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. </p>



<p>The Herald reports that videos from people in the area of the president&#8217;s home showed a person with an American accent yelling in English over a megaphone.  </p>



<p>“DEA operation. Everybody stand down. DEA operation. Everybody back up, stand down,&#8221; they said. </p>

<p>However, a high-ranking Haitian government official&nbsp;told the publication that the group was &#8220;mercenaries.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3235621/president-jovenel-moise-us-embassy-haiti-lockdown/">The US Embassy in Haiti is on lockdown</a> following the assassination. </p>



<p>The Biden administration has pledged that they will stand with the people of Haiti during this time.</p>



<p><a href="http://the-sun.com/who/joe-biden">President Joe Biden</a>&nbsp;said the attack is &#8220;very worrisome,&#8221; adding &#8220;we need a lot more information.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We are shocked and saddened to hear of the horrific assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and the attack on First Lady Martine Moïse of Haiti,&#8221; Biden said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We condemn this heinous act, and I am sending my sincere wishes for First Lady Moïse’s recovery. The United States offers condolences to the people of Haiti, and we stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure Haiti.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a horrific crime, and we&#8217;re so sorry for the loss that they are all suffering and going through as many of them are waking up this morning and hearing this news,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;And we stand ready and stand by them to provide any assistance that&#8217;s needed.&#8221;</p>



<p>She also went on to confirm that the embassy and State Department will be in touch with officials.</p>



<p>During his time in office, Moïse was accused of corruption and was faced with waves of anti-government protests.</p>



<p>In February, opposition politicians nominated their own president in an effort to drive out Moise whose five-year term had expired.</p>



<p>Joseph Mécène Jean-Louis, 72, a judge, said that he accepted the nomination.</p>



<p>Moïse insisted his term in office ended in February 2022 &#8211; a claim accepted by the United States.</p>



<p>On February 7, the day his presidential term was supposed to end, Moïse claimed that a coup had been foiled to overthrow his government and kill him.</p>



<p>A total of 23 people were arrested including a senior police officer.</p>

<p>A MYSTERIOUS hypersonic drone has been spotted at a Chinese airbase, it was reported.</p>



<p>The new images come as the Pentagon is probing whether Beijing is behind  the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/aliens-ufos/">UFOs</a> that have been buzzing US military aircraft.</p>

<p>The satellite images show what specialist defence website <a href="https://eurasiantimes.com/chinas-xinjiang-airbase-near-indian-border-hosting-hypersonic-drones-reports/">EurAsian Times</a> believes is a Chinese hypersonic drone, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10077394/china-worlds-first-stealth-armed-drone-us-defence/">possibly the Sharp Sword.</a></p>



<p>The images were taken at the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10077394/china-worlds-first-stealth-armed-drone-us-defence/">Malan airbase </a>in Xinjiang province and show a variety of drones lined up on a runway with the distinctive triangular outline of the Sharp Sword visible.</p>



<p>The airbase known to be on the leading edge of the country&#8217;s unmanned military aircraft development efforts,<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41386/flanker-fighter-appears-among-unmanned-aircraft-at-chinas-secretive-drone-test-base"> reports The Drive.</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">China</a> has put considerable efforts into developing drones for use both in the air and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15532750/china-top-secret-underwater-drone/">sea</a>, teaming them with Artificial Intelligence to make them capable of operating without human input.</p>



<p>In its recent report into UFOs, one explanation offered by the Pentagon was that advanced Chinese aircraft could be the mysterious objects buzzing US military aircraft.</p>



<img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ac-map-pentagon-ufo-sightings.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-large" />



<p>The report entitled Preliminary Assessment:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3158612/pentagon-ufo-report-finally-released-truth-revealed/">Unidentified Aerial Phenomena</a>, detailed what the government understands about a number of mysterious flying objects.</p>



<p>The nine-page report says &#8220;some UAP may be technologies deployed by China, Russia, another nation, or a non-governmental entity”.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the Pentagon&nbsp;has admitted the US Nav<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/2683726/us-navy-filmed-ufo-sky-video/">y filmed a triangle shaped UFO </a>swooping above two warships.</p>



<p>Startling footage captured by a US Navy destroyer using night vision cameras appears to show several mysterious flashing objects in the skies.</p>

<p>The view that they could be Chinese hypersonic drones <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14636909/ufo-us-navy-hypersonic-china-russia/">is backed by Nick Pope</a>, who investigated UFOs for the UK Ministry of Defence.</p>



<p>Pentagon investigators were convinced that the majority of the &#8220;unidentified aerial phenomenon&#8221; were physical objects, an official said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We absolutely do believe what we&#8217;re seeing are not simply sensor artifacts. These are things that physically exist,&#8221; they said, adding that 80 percent of the incidents included data from more than one sensor.</p>

<p>The first reports to be confirmed by the Pentagon date back to a now-infamous event in 2004.</p>



<p>It unfolded before the eyes of two warplane pilots from aircraft carrier USS Nimitz which was on a routine training mission in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, California.</p>



<p>Pilots described seeing ‘tic-tac’ like objects the sky that were filmed by on-board cameras.</p>

<h2>What does pandemic mean?</h2>



<p>A <a href="http://the-sun.com/topic/pandemic">pandemic</a> is a disease outbreak that spreads across countries or continents.</p>



<p>It affects more people and takes more lives than an epidemic.</p>



<p>For example, when <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/coronavirus/">COVID-19</a> began spreading and it became clear that the illness was severe,<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/686322/what-is-world-health-organisation-funding/"> The World Health Organization (WHO)</a> declared it to be a pandemic.</p>



<p>A simple way to remember what a pandemic is to “…remember the &#8216;P&#8217; in a pandemic, which means a pandemic has a passport.,” according to <a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/blogs/topics/live-well/2020/04/whats-the-difference-between-a-pandemic-an-epidemic-endemic-and-an-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intermountainhealthcare.org</a>.</p>



<p>“A pandemic is an epidemic that travels.”</p>



<p>There have been many notable past pandemics in world history that killed many including <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/2962403/bubonic-plague-vomiting-blood-black-death-outbreak/">The Black Death </a>(25million), <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/184/what-caused-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-and-what-was-the-death-toll/">the influenza pandemic of 1918</a> (50million), <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/251180/tv-host-chris-packham-says-smallpox-malaria-and-measles-helps-regulate-our-population/">Smallpox</a> (300million) and <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/hiv-and-aids/">HIV and AIDS</a> (32million).</p>



<figure id="attachment_15535662" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/723e6f4e-bc85-469d-bcf5-673d0c50dbf5.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15535662" width="960" height="639" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>An epidemic is actively spreading[/caption]



<h2>What does epidemic mean?</h2>



<p>An epidemic is a disease that affects a large number of people within a community, population, or region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An epidemic is actively spreading as new cases of disease substantially exceed what is expected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oftentimes, an epidemic is localized to a region, but the number of those infected in that region is significantly higher than normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, when COVID-19 was limited to <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/china/">Wuhan, China</a>, it was an epidemic.</p>



<p>The spread geographically turned it into a pandemic.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15535664" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664485405.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15535664" width="960" height="641" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Knowing the difference between pandemic and epidemic is important[/caption]



<h2>Why is it important to know the difference?</h2>



<p>Knowing the difference between pandemic and epidemic is important to help understand public health news and appropriate public health responses.</p>



<p>In 1999, WHO released the first influence pandemic preparedness plan outlining the appropriate response based on six clearly outlined phases.</p>



<p>The goal for the plan was to coordinate the global response by providing countries a drawn-up blueprint to follow national strategies based on available resources.</p>



<p>In 2009, a new WHO’s pandemic alert system ranging from Phase 1 (a low rise) to Phase 6 (a full pandemic) was designed.</p>



<p>Phase 1: A virus in animals has caused no known infections in humans.</p>



<p>Phase 2: A animal virus has caused infection in humans.</p>



<p>Phase 3: Scattered cases or small clusters of disease in humans are found. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A WOMAN was brutally caned in public just for being “too close” to her boyfriend in Indonesia.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Images of the horrific incident show the woman, dressed in a white hijab, kneeling on the ground.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15534634" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664546143.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15534634" width="960" height="583" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Floggings are carried out by Sharia police for a range of offences[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15534636" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 694px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664546017.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=684" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15534636" width="684" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>The incident took place in Banda Aceh, the capital and largest city in the province of Aceh[/caption]



<p>A person in maroon robes and a face covering stands alongside, and raises a cane, that appears to be made out of bamboo, in preparation to hit her.</p>



<p>The woman was reportedly being caned by a member of the Sharia police as punishment, under Aceh province’s Sharia laws, for being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The woman&#8217;s boyfriend was also publicly caned by a member of the Sharia police as punishment for their &#8220;crime&#8221;.</p>



<p>The incident took place in Banda Aceh, the capital and largest city in the province of Aceh on Thursday.</p>



<p>Aceh, a deeply conservative province which the majority of residents are Muslim, is the country’s only region with the autonomy to enforce <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11449057/coronavirus-brutal-caning-unmarried-couple-indonesia/">sharia law</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Floggings are carried out by authorities for a range of offences, including drinking booze, adultery, and engaging in premarital or homosexual sex.</p>



<p>In 2018, the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/7188189/indonesia-sharia-law-bans-women-men-eating-together/">authorities in the province</a> announced unmarried couples will be banned from sitting at the same table in restaurants, cafes or coffee shops under a religious crackdown.</p>



<p>The brutal punishment is widely seen as a warped interpretation of sharia law &#8211; an Islamic criminal code that seeks to prohibit “morality” offenses.</p>



<p>In 2018, Aceh officials vowed to end <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15445807/woman-collapses-agony-flogged-public-sex/">public floggings</a> and carry them out behind prison walls.</p>



<p>In spite of the promises, the number of public floggings and canings has reportedly risen.</p>



<p>The most vicious punishment is 100 lashes, which is administered for the most severe crimes along with prison time.</p>



<p>Human rights groups have condemned the brutal punishments as inhumane, but they have wide support in Aceh.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10489782/indonesia-flogging-premarital-sex/">Amnesty International has condemned the practice</a>, saying last year the canings are violations of international human rights law.</p>



<p>The group said: &#8220;Punishable offences include consensual intimacy or sexual activity for unmarried couples, consensual sex outside marriage, same-sex sexual relations, the consumption and sale of alcohol, and gambling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Under international human rights law all forms of corporal punishment are prohibited – they violate the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and often torture.&#8221;</p>

<p>CHINA has revealed it is developing a top secret underwater drone designed to track and destroy enemy submarines with no human input.</p>



<p>The unmanned attack robot was first test fired in the Taiwan Strait a decade ago but its existence was not made public until now.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15534097" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 798px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/KH-GRAPHIC-CHINA-TOP-SECRET-AI-DRONE-V2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=788" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15534097" width="788" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">China is developing an underwater attack robot to destroy enemy subs autonomously</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<figure id="attachment_15533820" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664587915.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15533820" width="960" height="587" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Harbin Engineering University</figcredit></figure>A research paper described a successful test of the drone in the Taiwan Strait[/caption]



<p>The project to build the drone was funded by the People&#8217;s Liberation Army and dates back to the 1990s, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3140220/china-reveals-secret-programme-unmanned-drone-submarines-dating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports the South China Morning Post</a>.</p>



<p>Under testing, it was reportedly able to detect a dummy submarine, identify its origin and hit it with a torpedo.</p>



<p>The craft is said to&nbsp;rely entirely on artificial intelligence and does not need any instructions from an operator.</p>



<p>Details of the part-declassified project were revealed in an academic paper last week.</p>



<p>Researchers described a 2010 test in the Taiwan Strait in which a drone was programmed to follow a pre-set course around 30ft below the surface.</p>



<p>When its sonar detected another craft, the drone changed course and circled the target, using onboard sensors to gather readings which were analysed by its computer.</p>



<p>It then fired autonomously and hit the dummy submarine with an unarmed torpedo.</p>



<p>Professor Liang Guolong, who led the team,&nbsp;said that with more advanced technology the drones would be able to hunt in packs.</p>



<p>&#8220;The needs of future underwater warfare bring new development opportunities for unmanned platforms,&#8221; the researchers said in their paper, published in the Journal of Harbin Engineering University on Friday.</p>



<p>Observers said the timing of the paper was significant as it comes amid <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/14633650/china-record-number-nuke-bombers-fighter-jets-taiwan/">rising fears China might invade</a> self-ruled Taiwan.</p>



<p>It also sends a signal to the US and its allies that any defence of the independent island nation would be fraught with&nbsp;risk.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unclear why China has now declassified details of the test, but the tension over the Taiwan Strait has recently escalated to its highest point in decades,&#8221; the SCMP report noted.</p>



<p>Last week a state-run paper published <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3203525/ww3-fears-chinese-state-media-three-stage-battle-plan/">a terrifying three stage battle plan</a> laying out how Beijing would overrun Taiwan.</p>



<p>Several countries have developed unmanned submarines, but none has ever been used in combat.</p>



<p>They are most commonly used for underwater surveillance and mapping the sea floor.</p>



<p>Drones were used in the unsuccessful search for <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9407441/Author-reveals-startling-new-theory-missing-Malaysia-Airlines-MH370-jet.html">missing jet MH370</a> in the Indian Ocean west of Australia.</p>

<p>A TIKTOK star has described the terrifying moment two creepy men spiked her friend&#8217;s drink and tried to take her home.</p>



<p>TikTok star @Aili.likes.adventures told of her &#8220;scary experience&#8221; to &#8220;stop this from happening to someone else&#8221;.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15533388" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 710px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664569849.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=700" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15533388" width="700" height="899" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>TikTok/aili.likes.adventure</figcredit></figure>TikTok user @aili.likes.adventure reveals the moment she had her and a friend&#8217;s drinks spiked[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15533394" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 710px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664569846-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=700" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15533394" width="700" height="899" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>TikTok/aili.likes.adventure</figcredit></figure>The young American is sharing her experience to &#8216;stop this from happening to someone else&#8217;[/caption]



<p>The young American had been out for drinks with friends at a bar when the men first approached, asking if they wanted a round.</p>



<p>When the girls said no, the men sat right next to their table and waited for them to hit the dancefloor and followed them.</p>



<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t really a bid deal because we just told everyone who asked to dance with us that we&#8217;re gay and we&#8217;re just trying to dance with each other,&#8221; Aili says in the video.</p>



<p>&#8220;But these men were kind of persistent.</p>



<p>&#8220;So by the end of the night, it&#8217;s just me and my friend dancing together. And the two guys from earlier come up to us and shove beers in our hands.</p>



<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t say we bought you these drinks. They didn&#8217;t say, did you want to drink? They just put them in our hands&#8221;.</p>



<p>Aili said she had &#8220;a voice drop in my head&#8221; pleading for her not to down the free beverage.</p>



<p>&#8220;So instead of drinking it, I put it back in his hand and I said, &#8216;you drink it&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;He was stunned. He literally backed away and all he could say was &#8216;no&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;So I pushed it out again and I said, &#8216;take a drink,&#8217; and he said, &#8216;no, I got it for you.'&#8221; </p>



<p>The two fought over the drink until Aili &#8220;stopped my friend from drinking, grabbed her by the arm&#8221; and left, with the TikTok sensation pushing one of the creeps off her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank God, I&#8217;m a strong a*s b**ch,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;As my friend went from being able to dance with me and talk to me to stumbling around, barely able to form a sentence, just like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Urging her followers to be more cautious, she said: &#8220;If something doesn&#8217;t feel right it&#8217;s because it is not right.&#8221;</p>

<p>A woman from the subprovincial city of Shenyang in the Chinese province of Liaoning, is the owner of an extensive collection of cuddly teddy bears.</p>



<p>The collection requires regular cleaning to be kept spick and span as the stuffed toys attract dust.</p>



<p>While the woman was in the middle of spring cleaning, her pooch, appropriately named Teddy, was trying to play with the toys interfering with the cleanup.</p>



<p>She eventually picked him up and dumped him in the middle of them so she could get on with the task at hand.</p>



<p>Shortly afterwards, when she wanted to take a break she realised her dog had fallen asleep between the teddy bears and she could not find him.</p>



<p>She then grabbed her phone and filmed the amusing incident to share online and see if any of her pals could spot him.</p>



<p>The clip quickly went viral with eagle-eyed social media users trying to spot the hidden pup.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;I have around 200 vintage teddy bears, although in this video there are 200 vintage teddy bears and one very real cuddly dog.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added that the dog was known locally as a teddy dog, also known as a Shichon, which is a mixed breed dog–a cross between the Shih Tzu and the Bichon Frise dog breeds.</p>



<p>Shichons go by a few other names including the Shih Tzu-Bichon mix, Zuchon, and of course the Teddy Bear dog.</p>

<p>BRITAIN’s top warrior slammed bungling politicians for the chaos engulfing Afghanistan as he insisted our soldiers “were never beaten” in the deadly 20-year campaign.</p>



<p>Over 150,000 troops who served in Afghanistan should “hold their heads up very high” for fighting with distinction, General Sir Nick Carter said.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15532219" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 615px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664570735.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=605" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15532219" width="605" height="482" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Crown Copyright</figcredit></figure>British lost 457 lives and spent mor than £37 billion on 20 year campaign[/caption]



<p>“They were never beaten on the battlefield,” the chief of defence staff insisted.</p>



<p>&#8220;They showed phenomenal courage throughout that campaign.</p>



<p> “All of our veterans should hold their heads up high, because they have done something that their successors will be immensely impressed with.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes as the government announced the end of Britain&#8217;s involvement in the Nato-led mission which cost us 457 lives and £37 billion.</p>



<p>Boris Johnson said the military presence was &#8220;never intended to be permanent&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We and our Nato allies were always going to withdraw our forces. The only question was when, and there could never be a perfect moment,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>A handful of Special Forces will remain inside Afghanistan to protect Kabul’s greenzone.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15532056" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664022157.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15532056" width="960" height="633" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>US-led troops invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to topple the Taliban regime and bombed Al Qaeda positions the Tora Bora mountains[/caption]



<p>Gen Carter admitted that news from the country was “grim” as rampaging Taliban militants have captured half the rural districts.</p>



<p>And he warned the country could split along 1990s civil war lines after US President Biden ordered a sudden withdrawal without a proper peace deal.</p>



<p>Gen Carter, who served in Afghanistan, said the current deadly crisis was a “political problem that requires a political solution”.</p>



<p>He blamed a lack of political strategy.</p>



<p>His comments come days after President Biden appeared to wash his hands of Afghanistan, telling a reporter he had “zero responsibility” for the impoverished country’s future.</p>



<p>“The military can only hold the ring for others to deliver,” Gen Carter said.</p>



<p>“And the military have done that, I think, with distinction during the course of the last 20 years.”</p>



<h2>&#8216;NEVER BEATEN&#8217;</h2>



<p>Most British troops came home after a secret flag-lowering ceremony was held at Kabul airport on June 24.</p>



<p>“You might see some of the important institutions like the security forces fracturing along ethnic or tribal lines,” Gen Carter added.</p>



<p>“If that were to happen, I guess the Taliban will control part of the country.”</p>



<p>More than 150,000 Brits served in Afghanistan since 2001 and at least 457 died.</p>



<p>Thousands more lost limbs and suffered life changing injuries in a conflict which cost the taxpayer at least £37 billion.</p>



<p>“I am immensely proud of the tactical excellence that our military showed,” Gen Carter added.</p>



<p>Critics claim the military charged into the Taliban heartlands of southern Helmand province without understanding the risks in a bid to curry favour with the Americans.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15531984" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PHOTO-2021-07-08-09-09-11.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15531984" width="960" height="571" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Most British troops left Kabul in the last week of June, nearly 20 years after the 2001 invasion</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>It followed tensions in Basra, in southern Iraq, where US commanders accused the British army of not pulling its weight.</p>



<p>The original Helmand plan was, in 2006, was to create a safe development zone around the provincial capital Lashkar Gah.</p>



<p>But within a few weeks of deploying, crack airborne troops from 3 Para had been strung out in platoon houses and fighting for their lives, calling in Apache gunships to fire bullets the size of milk bottles at men in mud houses.</p>



<p>Gen Carter added: “My heart and thoughts every day go out 457 people who lost their lives in British service there, and of course the many more who are injured and are suffering the mental scars of battle.”</p>



<p>Thousands of Afghan troops have surrendered or retreated in the face a brutal Taliban onslaught.</p>



<p>Gen Carter said it was because they no longer had access to air support which had given them the edge in previous battles with insurgents.</p>



<p>He said British trained Afghan commanders had no choice but to abandon outlying districts in order consolidate their forces to protect provincial capitals.</p>



<p>However, he said it unlikely the Taliban would capture all of Afghanistan, partly because they get most support from only one ethnic group which accounts for roughly 40 per cent of the population.</p>



<p>Gen Carter said progress in Afghanistan since 2001 included 8.2 million more children in school.</p>

<p>A PHOTO of a snake&nbsp;lurking in the undergrowth has left some viewers doubting it is even there.</p>



<p>Facebook users stumped by the spot-the-snake challenge claimed those who shared the image are “pulling our collective leg”.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15531406" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664522809.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15531406" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Jam Press</figcredit></figure>A terrifying serpent is lurking somewhere in the undergrowth[/caption]



<p>The snap was posted online by Sunshine Coast&nbsp;Snake&nbsp;Catchers, based in Queensland, Australia.</p>



<p>It shows what appears to be an innocuous forest scene with grass and shrubs sprouting under the trees.</p>



<p>But a camouflaged reptile is hiding somewhere in the greenery – and followers have to try and spot it.</p>



<p>The image was shared to Facebook as part of the weekly game “Spot the&nbsp;Snake&nbsp;Sunday”.</p>



<p>It was captioned: “See how you go today guys! Keep an eye out for&nbsp;snakes&nbsp;today as the sun is back out!”</p>



<p>Amateur&nbsp;snake&nbsp;spotters from all over the globe attempted to solve the puzzle – and many of their answers were wide of the mark.</p>



<p>“There’s lots of&nbsp;snakes&nbsp;in this pic,” claimed one viewer.</p>



<p>“Which one do you mean,” joked another.</p>



<p>One confident guesser said: “I see it but can’t tell what kind. If I had to guess, I’d say a python.”</p>



<p>Some viewers were deliberately vague in their guesses.</p>



<p>One said: “Between the leaf on far left n leaf on far right.”</p>



<p>Another said: “Across the middle of the log more to the left.”</p>



<p>Other Facebook users admitted defeat and agreed to leave the job to the experts.</p>



<p>“Mate I struggle to find a spoon in the cutlery tray I got no hope,” said one.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15531407" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664522823.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15531407" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Jam Press</figcredit></figure>The snake is poking out from under a log[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15531405" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664522793.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15531405" width="960" height="795" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Jam Press</figcredit></figure>Experts said it is a coastal carpet python[/caption]



<p>“I would most likely step on it and get bitten because I’m useless at spot the&nbsp;snake!” admitted another.</p>



<p>One failed puzzler said: “I reckon you’re pulling our collective leg.</p>



<p>“I took a screen shot and then zoomed right in and went over the whole pic. I can&#8217;t see anything that resembles a&nbsp;snake???”</p>



<p>Sunshine Coast&nbsp;Snake&nbsp;Catchers later revealed the snake is hiding in the centre of the photo, poking out from under a log.</p>



<p>It has been identified as a coastal carpet python, the largest&nbsp;snake&nbsp;species in the Brisbane area.</p>



<p>They can grow up to 14ft and although non-venomous are able to cause serious injuries with their bites.</p>

<p>Destin said a maid and a boy on duty were tied up by a group of armed commandos who shouted &#8220;DEA operation&#8221; as they entered the property.</p>



<p>The gunmen, who Haitian officials claim are &#8220;foreign mercenaries&#8221; that spoke a mix of Spanish and English with an American accent, then ransacked the president&#8217;s office and bedroom.</p>



<p>Moïse&#8217;s daughter, Jomarlie, survived by hiding in her brother&#8217;s room.</p>



<p>No one other than President Moïse and First Lady Martine Moïse were shot.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://lenouvelliste.com/article/230281/le-president-jovenel-moise-a-ete-crible-de-balles-selon-les-minutes-du-constat-legal">Haitian media</a>, Destin said the President was found &#8220;lying on his back, [with] blue pants, a white shirt stained with blood, his mouth open, his left eye gouged out&#8221; and with &#8220;twelve orifices&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We saw a bullet impact at the level of his forehead, one in each nipple, three at the hip, one in the abdomen &#8220;, he added, stressing the bullet holes were made by a &#8220;large caliber weapon and with 9 mm projectiles”.</p>



<p>&#8220;Many 5.56 and 7.62 mm cartridge cases were found between the gatehouse and the interior of the residence,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523333/cops-shoot-gunmen-president-haiti/">Four foreign mercenaries suspected of killing have been shot dead and two more have been arrested</a> following a bloody gun battle in the streets of Port-au-Price, Haitian law enforcement has said.</p>



<p>Police chief Leon Charles said his men &#8220;blocked&#8221; the group from leaving President Moïse&#8217;s compound and have been <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523333/cops-shoot-gunmen-president-haiti/">&#8220;battling&#8221; them</a> <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523333/cops-shoot-gunmen-president-haiti/">ever since</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Four mercenaries were killed [and] two were intercepted under our control,&#8221; he said,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-57750358">BBC</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Three policemen who had been taken hostage have been recovered. We blocked [the suspects] en route as they left the scene of the crime. Since then, we have been battling with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Interim Prime Minister Clause Joseph said President Moïse was shot dead by a group of &#8220;foreigners who spoke English and Spanish&#8221; who disguised themselves at US Drug Enforcement Agency agents.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister declared a two-week &#8220;stage of siege&#8221;, imposing martial law, which has seen the Caribbean nation&#8217;s borders sealed and all flights out of Port-au-Prince halted.</p>



<p>Another official called the assassins &#8211; who are yet to be identified &#8211; &#8220;well trained professional commandos&#8221; and &#8220;foreign mercenaries&#8221; who carried high-powered guns and dressed in black,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/explainer-assassination-threatens-more-chaos-for-haiti">Fox News</a>&nbsp;writes.</p>



<p>Video footage from the capital on Wednesday showed smoke billowing from several areas and sounds of gunfire, though it&#8217;s unsure if this was related to the police sting.</p>



<p>Neighbouring Dominican Republic troops have amassed along Haiti&#8217;s land border.</p>



<p>Video has emerged showing gunmen allegedly posing as DEA agents storming the politician&#8217;s home before he was shot dead in front of his terrified wife.</p>



<p>The dramatic footage shows a series of cars rolling towards Moïse&#8217;s house as other armed gang members follow on foot at 1am local time (5am GMT).</p>



<p>Just moments later the premier<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15517735/haiti-president-jovenel-moise-assassinated/">&nbsp;was gunned down</a>&nbsp;in what has been branded a &#8220;hateful, inhumane and barbaric act&#8221;.</p>



<p>The First Lady, Martine Moïse, is fighting for her life after being shot multiple times in the attack.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3239343/haitian-president-wife-martine-moise-arrives-florida-treatment-assassination/">The 47-year-old has since been flown to Florida and taken to Baptist Hospital in Miami for treatment</a>, where she is in a stable but critical condition, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/07/1014022342/4-suspected-killers-of-president-jovenel-moise-have-been-slain-2-arrested?utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;t=1625709364111&amp;t=1625729186297">NPR</a>.</p>



<p>Haiti&#8217;s ambassador to the US, Bocchit Edmond, said there was &#8220;no way&#8221; US drug agents carried out the bloody attack.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Joseph has stepped in as de-facto leader, promising to take &#8220;all measures&#8230;to ensure continuity&#8221; of &#8220;democracy and the republic&#8221;.</p>



<p>Though questions have been raised about Joseph&#8217;s legitimacy after Moïse&nbsp;appointed Ariel Henry as Prime Minister this week.</p>



<p>Haiti&#8217;s constitution also says the president of the Supreme Court should take over as prime minister in the event of a presidental vacancy.</p>



<p>In February, opposition politicians nominated their own president in an effort to drive out Moise whose five-year term had expired.</p>



<p>Joseph Mécène Jean-Louis, 72, a judge, said that he accepted the nomination.</p>



<p>Moïse insisted his term in office ended in February 2022 &#8211; a claim accepted by the United States.</p>



<p>On February 7, the day his presidential term was supposed to end, Moïse claimed that a coup had been foiled to overthrow his government and kill him.</p>



<p>A total of 23 people were arrested including a senior police officer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thank my head of security at the palace,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life. That plan was aborted.&#8221;</p>



<p>During his time in office, Moïse was accused of corruption and was faced with waves of anti-government protests.</p>

<p>THIS is the moment brutal Spanish cops pepper-sprayed England fans who were celebrating the semi-final win over Denmark in Magaluf.</p>



<p>Armed police officers were filmed marching down Punta Ballena strip, ordering tourists who were celebrating the country&#8217;s win off the road and onto the pavement.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15530998" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6d973b15-634c-4b98-b1f6-3f4310b47c72.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15530998" width="960" height="810" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Solarpix</figcredit></figure>Fans were celebrating the win over Denmark[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15530538" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664516203.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15530538" width="960" height="641" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Solarpix</figcredit></figure>Spanish cops were seen pepper-spraying England fans[/caption]



<p>An officer used his pepper spray a bare-chested Brit who was pushed to the kerb as his colleagues walked past others who broke off singing: ‘Football’s Coming Home’ to jeer them as they appeared.</p>



<p>Many revellers were seen in obvious discomfort as they pull up their T-shirts to cover their mouths and rub their eyes.</p>



<p>Earlier in the evening, another Brit risked a fine by provocatively walking behind a police patrol car advancing slowly up the strip with a can of his drink in his hand.</p>



<p>He appeared to lap up the attention he was getting from other revellers as he held his arms high in the air and sang ‘Football’s Coming Home’ with other shirtless friends by his side.</p>



<p>The appearance of the Civil Guard was met with boos from England fans who forgot social distancing recommendations to dance in the street with no face masks on and throw drinks over each other as the final whistle blew on another great performance from Gareth Southgate’s boys.</p>



<p>One Brit could be overheard shouting: “I’ve just been hit by a baton” as the patrol officers cleared the street.<br><br>Local town hall-employed police also joined them in trying to maintain order.</p>



<p>There were no immediate reports of any injuries or arrests.</p>



<p>It comes as cops in Magaluf have been <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15487412/magaluf-armed-cops-disgraceful-brits/">ordered to crackdown on &#8220;disgraceful&#8221; behaviour</a> such as heavy boozing and fights.</p>

<p>It follows a regional government decision to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/15504588/majorca-ibiza-new-rules-holiday-bars/">introduce special regulations in bars and restaurants in Majorca and Ibiza</a> in a bid to control so-called &#8220;tourism of excesses.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sun-starved Brits flocked the island for the first time after it <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/15477883/brits-return-to-magalufs-strip-as-covid-restrictions-stay/">was added to the UK&#8217;s green list</a>.</p>



<p>The new set of rules includes pubs and restaurants closing at 2am&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the local council imposes an earlier rule and only six people can sit at a table inside and ten people outside.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our commitment continues to be zero permissiveness with uncivil attitudes that disturb coexistence in these areas and damage their image,&#8221; warned Minister of Tourism and Labour and spokesman for the Government Iago Negueruela.</p>



<p>British Consul General Lloyd Milen said: &#8221;We want people to have a holiday to remember, not one to forget&#8221; as he promoted an update of the Foreign Office’s 2019 ‘Stick With Your Mates’ campaign to help British tourists stay safe on nights out.</p>



<p>Last month <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/15391993/dont-cause-drunken-carnage-ibiza-majorca-new-quarantine-warned/">Brits were warned against causing drunken carnage</a> as officials urged tourists heading to resorts like Magaluf and San Antonio to be “responsible.”</p>



<p>Popular hotspots including the famous Punta Ballena strip <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12138418/bladdered-sunburnt-brits-hit-magalufs-punta-ballena-strip-hours-before-its-shut-down-for-summer-over-bad-behaviour/">were closed down last year</a>  in a bid to crackdown on anti-social behaviour and the dangers involved with Covid.</p>



<p>And while the island reopened and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15394868/magaluf-beach-gets-ready-brits-balearic-islands-green-list/">got ready to welcome back Brits</a>, tourism bosses are determined &nbsp;to shake off the town&#8217;s infamous party resort&nbsp;image post Covid.</p>



<p>Javier Pascuet, director general of tourism for Calvia, previously told The Sun Online that the pandemic restrictions are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/13958762/brits-magaluf-post-lockdown-holiday-summer/">helping them enforce changes to the image of the party town</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Pascuet told The Sun Online: “The normal Covid regulations will be in place for tourists visiting so in bars there will be a limit to the number of people allowed in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There will be no&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7428778/magaluf-killjoys-ban-inbetweeners-boat-party-booze-brits-mayhen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">party boats</a>, pub crawls or happy hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That means all you can drink, offers like two-for-one drinks, there will be none of that. There will be areas of Magaluf you can’t drink so there will be quiet, family areas.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A MUM-of-two who refused the Covid vaccine over fears of side effects, died after catching the Delta variant.</p>



<p>Tricia Jones, 45, was hesitant about getting the jab after hearing news reports about people suffering rare side effects like blood clots or heart inflammation.</p>

<p>So far in the UK more than 45 million Brits have had a first dose, with more than 33 million also having had a second.</p>



<p>Very few recipients of the vaccine experienced serious side effects. </p>



<p>After deciding to wait to get the jab, Missouri mum Jones contracted the Delta variant in the spring, and never recovered.</p>



<p>According to FOX 4 reports, Jones was hospitalised and placed on a mechanical ventilator within a month of contracting the virus.</p>



<p>She passed away soon after.</p>



<p>Jones’ family is now urging the public to get vaccinated, to minimise their risk of falling ill with Covid-19 like she did.</p>



<p>The news of Jones’ death follows on the heels of reports that the highly transmissible delta variant is now the dominant strain of the coronavirus in the United States.</p>



<p>The strain now makes up 51.7 per cent of all new infections, according to <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">reports </a>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Deborah Carmichael, Jones’ mother, told FOX 4 that she had received her Covid-19 vaccine in the spring, shortly after it became available to her.</p>



<p>However, her daughter was undecided and nervous about side effects, so wanted to wait.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15529793" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664537492.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=530" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15529793" width="530" height="340" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>FOX4</figcredit></figure>Jones’ health went downhill rapidly after she contracted the Delta variant[/caption]



<p>&#8216;You hear a lot of horror stories,” Carmichael said.</p>



<p>“When I had the shot, it was rough, so it scared her and freaked her out. So she didn&#8217;t want to do it. I couldn&#8217;t convince her.&#8217;</p>



<p>Jones’ son contracted Covid-19 at his middle school back in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, it was discovered that his infection was linked to the Delta variant.</p>



<p>Jones and her husband, Keith, contracted the virus not long after.</p>



<p>The Delta variant, which was also known as B.1.617.2, has been labelled as a “double mutant” by India’s Health Ministry, because it carries two mutations: L452R and E484Q.</p>



<p>The former is&nbsp; the same mutation identified in the California homegrown variant, while E484Q is similar to the mutation seen in the Brazilian and South African variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delta’s biological advantage of being able to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15214833/delta-variant-60-percent-more-infectious-third-wave-ferguson/">spread faster</a> than any other variant allowed it to become rampant.</p>



<p>The strain, which was first identified in India, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15464415/delta-cases-rise-50000-jabs-brits-out-hospital/">makes up almost every new Covid case </a>in the UK (95 per cent).</p>



<p>Carmichael said after her daughter contracted the virus, she said: &#8220;Mom you were right, about the shot, about masks, being diligent and all that”.</p>



<p>“I was like: ‘I don&#8217;t want to be right. I want you to be well. That&#8217;s all that matters’.”</p>



<p>After this point, Jones’ health went downhill rapidly.</p>



<p>She was hospitalized at Research Medical Center in Kansas City in early May and placed on a ventilator on May 13.</p>



<p>While her Covid-19 symptoms gradually disappeared, her respiratory health never improved.</p>



<p>On June 9, she passed away.</p>



<p>Her distraught mother said she “never would have thought” she would lose her daughter, at just 45.</p>



<p>“It wasn&#8217;t my choice. It wasn&#8217;t what I wanted. Everything in me was screaming: ‘No, this can&#8217;t be right. She&#8217;s only 45’.”</p>



<p>Jones’ family was now bidding all Americans to get their vaccine.</p>

<p>BLOODSHED, massacres and potential civil war all could return to Haiti as the country sits on a knife edge following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.</p>



<p>The troubled Caribbean nation has had a long and violent history as it has been buffeted between dictatorships, military juntas and foreign interventions or occupations since first gaining independence in 1804.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523311/meet-haitian-president-jovenel-moise-death-details-revealed/">Moïse</a> was allegedly killed by a group of  foreign &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15523333/cops-shoot-gunmen-president-haiti/">well-trained commandos</a>&#8221; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/15518391/who-assassinated-jovenel-moise/">posing as US drug enforcement agents</a> who stormed his presidential compound in Port-au-Prince.</p>



<p>The motive behind <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15517735/haiti-president-jovenel-moise-assassinated/">his assassination</a> remains unclear &#8211; but it comes after ongoing political turmoil, accusations he was trying to become a dictator, and an attempted coup in February.</p>



<p>His murder also follows a spate of high profile killings, including prominent human rights activist Antoinette Duclair&nbsp;and high profile journalist Diego Charles. </p>



<p>Decades of unrest have already plagued <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/haiti/">Haiti</a> &#8211; with street violence, the rise of powerful and brutal gangs, mass protests and a slow collapse of a weak, corrupt police force. </p>



<p>And to further complicate things the temporary president is supposed to be the nation&#8217;s Chief Justice, René Sylvestre &#8211; but he died last month of Covid. </p>



<p>With no one in charge &#8211; and various factions vying for power &#8211; the threat of mass civil unrest  or potentially even civil war, hangs over Haiti. </p>



<p>Moïse&#8217;s wife Martine was also hurt in the attack which has pushed Haiti to the brink as the world waits with bated breath.</p>



<p>The ailing government has announced that four of the assassins had been killed and two have been arrested &#8211; but this will likely do little to stem the chaos.</p>



<p>Videos show the worrying scenes as smoke rises of Port-au-Prince as gun battles rage amid the crackdown.</p>



<p>The specter of a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15521477/us-could-send-troops-haiti/">potential foreign intervention by the US</a> has already been raised by observers, and the country has entered a &#8220;state of siege&#8221;. </p>

<p>It means the country is under martial law &#8211; with the cops and military able to enter people&#8217;s homes at will, control traffic and take &#8220;all general measures&#8221; to keep order.</p>



<p>Professor Robert Fatton, who has written several books on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/haiti/">Haiti&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;turbulent history, grimly said the situation is likely to &#8220;degenerate&#8221; and the country to be &#8220;plunged into chaos&#8221;.</p>



<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBw8n-N3i4k">France24</a>. Professor Fatton said: &#8220;We don&#8217;t know what is going to happen &#8211; we can only assume things will probably degenerate given the lack of security, the weak police and the rise of gangs in cities.</p>



<p>He went on: &#8220;It may plunge the country into chaos and talking to some people from Haiti there is a feeling it might also provoke a foreign occupation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shocking acts of violence are not uncommon in Haiti &#8211; with Unicef warning last month that thousands of people were fleeing the country to escape the brutality of gangs, with 13 massacres &#8211; killing 437 &#8211; reported since 2018.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s the worst we’ve seen. Gangs have so much power, and they are tolerated,&#8221;  Pierre Espérance, executive director of the Haitian National Human Rights Defense Network, told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/15/haiti-gang-violence-women-children-port-au-prince-unicef-flee-homes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>. </p>



<p>Perhaps one of the most shocking was the slaughter in Port-au-Prince in November, 2018, where 25 civilians were rounded up and killed by men in police uniform. </p>



<p>&#8220;Cops&#8221; armed with machetes and assault weapons executed people in the streets &#8211; with officials at the time warning the slums of the city were becoming a &#8220;lawless zone&#8221;.</p>



<p>The brutality followed the exit of UN peacekeepers in 2017 &#8211; who had boasted the condition on the island had improved after the overthrow of President Bertrand Aristide in 2004.</p>



<p>His ousting followed him being propped up by a US intervention in 1994 which saw American forces occupy Haiti after the government was seized in a military coup.</p>

<p>It is estimated around 200 protesters and 44 police officers have been killed in protests since 2018 &#8211; with fiery clashes between the two sides. </p>



<p>Fury mounted over Moïse&#8217;s increased grip on power, Haiti&#8217;s growing economic crisis, and the government&#8217;s failures over the Covid pandemic.</p>



<p>World Health Organisation officials have warned this new wave of turmoil is set to hamper efforts to stem the outbreak and slow the essential role out of vaccines.</p>



<p>WHO have said they believe the country&#8217;s cases and deaths &#8211; 19,107 and 462 &#8211; is vastly underreported and the virus has been surging in recent weeks.</p>



<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VP-MAP-HAITI-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VP-MAP-HAITI-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15530680" width="960" height="897" /></a>



<p>Haiti has also been dealing with a cholera outbreak which has ravaged the country since a devastating earthquake in 2010, that killed as many as 300,000 people and caused $8billion worth of damage.</p>



<p>It was in the aftermath that Haiti&#8217;s armed gangs started to seize power &#8211; exploiting a heartbroken nation that was having to bury its dead in mass graves.</p>



<p>Professor Fatton said: &#8220;I assume foreign powers will be very worried about this situation in Haiti, in particular the United States.</p>



<p>&#8220;And as we know in the previous 20 or 30 years, the UN and United States &#8211; and actually France &#8211; have sent troops to Haiti because of political uncertainty and instability.</p>

<p>&#8220;If things get bad &#8211; I would assume you would probably have another intervention.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, he went on that Haitians may push back against such an operation as many actually blame the US and other foreign powers for their current troubles.</p>



<p>Fulton Armstrong, who was the CIA&#8217;s chief in Haiti during the 90s, told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/07/crisis-threatens-to-engulf-a-leaderless-haiti-mired-in-and-corruption">The Guardian</a>: &#8220;When you have these permissive escalations of violence, where innocent people get shot or killed or kidnapped, if there is no action, then one of these goons-for-hire that Haitian politicians use is going to take a shot.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jake Johnston, a Haiti specialist from the Center for Economic and Policy Research thinktank, added: &#8220;This is a situation that has been building for some time.</p>



<p>&#8220;A huge part of this story is that when you have a situation where the police has failed to provide security to the population, anything becomes possible.&#8221;</p>

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					HAITI has suffered cycles of invasion, violence and repression since it first became independent in 1804.				</p>

			<div>
<p><strong>1492</strong> &#8211; Spain colonises the island of Hispaniola after the arrival of Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p><strong>1697</strong> &#8211; Spain cedes half the island to France, which eventually becomes the foundation of modern day  Haiti</p>
<p><strong>1801</strong> &#8211; Former slave Toussaint Louverture leads a successful revolt and abolishes slavery.</p>
<p><strong>1804</strong> &#8211; Haiti becomes independent under former slave Jean-Jacques Dessalines &#8211; he is assassinated in 1806.</p>
<p><strong>1915</strong> &#8211; The US invades Haiti and occupies it until 1943</p>
<p><strong>1957 </strong>&#8211; Francois &#8220;Papa Doc&#8221; Duvalier takes power &#8211; eventually declaring himself &#8220;president for life&#8221; ushering in a brutal, repressive rule</p>
<p><strong>1971</strong> &#8211; Duvalier dies and his son &#8220;Baby Doc&#8221; takes power &#8211; he is even more brutal than his father </p>
<p><strong>1986</strong> &#8211; Popular revolt forces him to flee &#8211; and the military take power</p>
<p><strong>1990</strong> &#8211; Former priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide wins Haiti&#8217;s first free election</p>
<p><strong>1991</strong> &#8211; Aristide is ousted in a coup</p>
<p><strong>1994</strong> &#8211; The US invade and occupy Haiti as Aristide returns, with his protégé Rene Preval elected president</p>
<p><strong>1999</strong> &#8211; Aristide is elected again despite a disputed election</p>
<p><strong>2004</strong> &#8211; Aristide is then ousted again amid waves of violence &#8211; the US and France send in the troops</p>
<p><strong>2010</strong> &#8211; Catastrophic earthquake kills up to 300,000 people &#8211; leading to mass devastation and outbreaks of cholera</p>
<p><strong>2017</strong> &#8211; Businessman Jovenel &#8220;Banana Man&#8221; Moise is elected president</p>
<p><strong>2019</strong> &#8211; Mass protests begin as he is perceived as attempting to set himself up as a dictator</p>
<p><strong>2021</strong> &#8211; Moise is killed in his home by &#8220;foreign mercenaries&#8221; &#8211; sparking a new era of uncertainty and chaos  </p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>In a statement today, the U.S Embassy in Haiti said that it would be closed to due to an &#8220;ongoing security situation&#8221;.</p>



<p>Boris Johnson said the assassination of Mr Moïse was an &#8220;abhorrent act&#8221; and appealed for calm in the country.</p>



<p>Streets were empty yesterdaymorning after Haitians woke up to the news of the death of their President.</p>



<p>The country&#8217;s main airport was closed except for humanitarian and diplomatic flights, the airport&#8217;s director general said.</p>

<p>On February 7, the day his presidential term was supposed to end,  Moïse claimed that a coup had been foiled to overthrow his government and kill him.</p>



<p>A total of 23 people were arrested including a senior police officer &#8211; and Moïse claimed they had tried to kill him. </p>



<p>Moïse had been ruling by decree for the last months, but he had originally been hoped to bring stability to the island &#8211; being a businessman with no political background, often dubbed &#8220;Banana Man&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, he found himself embroiled in political corruption as protesters urged him to resign as the nation failed to hold elections, branding him a &#8220;dictator&#8221;. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>DONALD Trump&#8217; and Melania Trump&#8217;s youngest son Barron appears to tower over his parents.</strong></p>
<p>The now 16-year-old teenager is often spotted in pictures with the former President and First Lady <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3241403/barron-trump-16-leaves-trump-tower-with-mom/">distinctly taller than them.</a></p>

<h2>How tall is Barron Trump?</h2>
<p>Barron Trump&#8217;s height is not publicly available as his parents try to keep him out of the public eye &#8211; and at 16 he could still be growing.</p>
<p>Some have speculated that Barron may stand at 6ft 6 inches tall, with many social media users saying that Trump&#8217;s youngest son would be an ideal basketball player.</p>
<p>A debate over his height was sparked when he was seen disembarking <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2346921/what-air-force-one-boeing-donald-trump-uk-trip/">Air Force One</a> with the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/donald-trump/">President</a> and First Lady in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10434190/donald-trump-son-barron-thanksgiving/">during the Thanksgiving weekend in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>It was one of the first times that Barron, then aged 13, appeared to be as tall as his 74-year-old father &#8211; who stands at 6ft 3.</p>
<p>Barron&#8217;s mum <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/">Melania</a> is 5ft 11 inches.</p>
<p>The teenager stood next to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/mike-pence/">Mike Pence</a> &#8211; who is 5ft 10 inches tall &#8211; during the 2020 Republican National Convention and the height difference was startling as the Vice President didn&#8217;t come up to the 14-year-old&#8217;s shoulder level.</p>

<h2>Who is Barron Trump?</h2>
<p>Trump’s youngest son Barron is his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2155526/ivanka-tiffany-eric-barron-donald-jr-trump/">only child with current wife and First Lady Melania Trump</a>.</p>
<p>Born in 2006 – a year after his parents’ 2005 nuptials – he is closer in age to his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2161436/ivanka-trump-first-lady-donald-us-election-2016/">eight nieces and nephews than to his siblings.</a></p>
<p>In fact, there is a 28-year difference between Barron and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/donald-trump-jr/">Donald Jr</a>.</p>
<p>His nickname is Little Donald because he shares so many similarities with his dad.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/">Melania</a> said: &#8220;He is a very strong-minded, very special, smart boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is independent and opinionated and knows exactly what he wants. Sometimes I call him little Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a mixture of us in looks, but his personality is why I call him ‘Little Donald’.”</p>
<p>Barron has appeared on TV alongside his dad on both <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/the-apprentice/">The Apprentice</a> and The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/oprah-winfrey/">Oprah Winfrey</a> Show.</p>
<p>He made few appearances during his father&#8217;s presidential campaign, with Melania saying the couple wished to shield him from the spotlight.</p>
<p>But he did attend Trump&#8217;s inauguration becoming a viral hit online after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2147584/donald-trumps-late-night-triumph-proves-too-much-for-his-exhausted-young-son-barron-who-can-barely-stay-awake-during-his-dads-victory-speech/">he couldn&#8217;t keep his eyes open at his father&#8217;s acceptance speech</a> after the 2016 election.</p>
<p>In October 2019, mum Melania revealed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12932903/barron-trump-tested-positive-coronavirus/">Barron had also tested positive</a> for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">coronavirus</a> when she and her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/us-news/12825832/first-lady-trump-feeling-good-coronavirus/">husband came down with the bug</a>.</p>
<p>Bilingual Barron speaks Slovenian with his mum and grandparents.</p>
<p>Melania has also spoken of his love for building big models &#8211; just like his dad&#8217;s Manhattan skyscrapers.</p>

<h2>Where does Barron Trump go to school?</h2>
<p>Barron remained living in Trump Tower, Manhattan, after his father became president and attended Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School in New York.</p>
<p>The school&#8217;s famous alumni include Breakfast Club actress Ally Sheedy, Charlotte&#8217;s Web director Gary Winick and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/6838689/sarah-michelle-gellar-age-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-reboot-married/">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>, who attended in 8th grade.</p>
<p>Moby Dick author Herman Melville also attended the school through the 6th grade.</p>
<p>The prestigious institution costs around £31,000 a year.</p>
<p>Barron then <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3779036/melania-trump-says-shes-looking-forward-to-making-memories-as-she-finally-moves-into-the-white-house-with-her-son-barron-five-months-after-the-donald/">moved with his mum to the White House in June 2017</a> and transferred to the prestigious St Andrew&#8217;s Episcopal School in suburban Maryland &#8211; which comes with a price tag of more than £38,000 a year.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_12934882" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12934882 size-thesun-article-image" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NINTCHDBPICT000604581294.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="Barron seen with his parents and Tiffany Trump during the Republican National Convention in August 2020" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Splash News</figcredit></figure> Barron seen with his parents and Tiffany Trump during the Republican National Convention in August 2020[/caption]</p>
<h2>Why did Barron Trump become a viral sensation after the inauguration?</h2>
<p>During Trump&#8217;s acceptance speech in 2016, Barron appeared to be struggling to keep his eyes open after 24 hours without sleep.</p>
<p>Unable to celebrate his dad’s Presidential success, the exhausted then 10-year-old rocked back and forth on his feet in a desperate bid to stay awake.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[






<p>RUSSIA has unleashed a barrage of cruise missiles in the Arctic in the latest war games by Vladimir Putin’s nuclear forces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drills involved both Tu-160 and Tu-95MS strategic bombers in major exercises, which came after recent clashes with the West.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15529434" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664515709.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15529434" width="960" height="542" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>A Russian Tu-95MS strategic bomber powers up to take part in war games in the Arctic[/caption]

<p>Russia flexed its military muscles in a show of strength after recent clashes with a Royal Navy&nbsp;destroyer and Nato war games in the Black Sea.</p>



<p>The bombers fired high-tech guided rockets from altitude and successfully hit targets on land, Russia’s aerospace forces announced today.</p>



<p>&#8220;During the tactical flight exercise, crews of the Tu-160 and Tu-95MS&nbsp;strategic bombers conducted launches of airborne cruise missiles at land-based targets at a firing range in the Arctic region,&#8221; a statement said.</p>



<p>The planes took off from an airfield in the Saratov region and covered a distance of more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles).</p>



<p>Footage released by the defence ministry does not show the cruise missiles pummelling the Arctic.</p>



<p>But it highlights a Tu-95MS firing from stern air guns at targets in the Irkutsk region in Siberia.&nbsp;</p>

<figure id="attachment_15529437" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664515714.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15529437" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>The drills were a show of strength after recent clashes with Nato forces[/caption]



<p>The Tu-160 &#8211; known as White Swan &#8211; is a supersonic variable-sweep wing heavy strategic nuclear bomber with the Nato reporting name of Blackjack.</p>



<p>It is the world’s heaviest combat aircraft, and the fastest bomber in use today.&nbsp;It entered service in 1987.</p>



<p>The Tu-95 with contra-rotating propellers is known to Nato as &#8220;Bear&#8221;, and was first flown in 1952.</p>



<p>Russia intends to keep it flying until 2040.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia’s strategic nuclear forces are this year reported to be conducting&nbsp; more than one military exercise every two days.</p>



<p>Their latest drills &#8211; due to continue until tomorrow &#8211; come two weeks after a major international incident when a Russian pilot claimed he dropped bombs in the path of HMS Defender off the coast of Crimea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So-called <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15369390/russia-uk-fires-warning-navy-ship-black-sea/">“warning shots” were also fired from FSB coastal patrol vessels</a>&nbsp;as tensions between East and West reach their highest since the Cold War.</p>



<p>This week Russia claimed two Su-30 fighters <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15520419/russia-deploys-fighters-jets/">intercepted a US Navy P-8 Poseidon spy plane</a> and blocked it from entering its air space.</p>



<h2>&#8216;PROVOCATION&#8217;</h2>



<p>Russia also deployed Tu-22M3 long range bombers over the Black Sea as it warned the West against repeating the “provocation” of HMS Defender sailing close to annexed Crimea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The giant supersonic warplanes buzzed the sea for five hours escorted by Su-30 fighters&nbsp;as Nato forces joined Ukraine for the annual Sea Breeze military exercises.</p>



<p>Putin’s spokesman hit back at a comment by UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab that Royal Navy warships would continue to ply international shipping routes south of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia claims HMS Defender entered its territorial waters around Crimea but the West does not recognise the Kremlin’s jurisdiction over the disputed region.</p>



<p>“Every time when Russia’s state border is violated, the necessary measures will be taken,” warned spokesman Dmitry Peskov.</p>



<p>&#8220;The border guards will take steps stipulated by all instructions in the event of state frontier violations and certainly, all diplomatic tools will be also used.”</p>



<p>He also warned: “They simply should not violate Russia’s state border, nor should they do this in an absolutely provocative way.”</p>

<p>FOUR foreign mercenaries suspected of killing the Haitian President were killed and two more have been arrested following a bloody gun battle, police have said.</p>



<p>Police chief Leon Charles said his men &#8220;blocked&#8221; the group from leaving President Jovenel Moïse&#8217;s compound and have been &#8220;battling&#8221; them ever since.</p>

<p>Three officers were taken hostage and subsequently released while an unspecified number of attackers were able to escape, Charles said, adding they would be &#8220;killed or arrested&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Four mercenaries were killed [and] two were intercepted under our control,&#8221; Charles said,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-57750358">BBC</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;Three policemen who had been taken hostage have been recovered. We blocked [the suspects] en route as they left the scene of the crime. Since then, we have been battling with them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another official called the assassins &#8220;well trained professional commandos&#8221; and &#8220;foreign mercenaries&#8221; who carried high-powered guns and dressed in black, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/explainer-assassination-threatens-more-chaos-for-haiti">Fox News</a> writes.</p>



<p>The suspects killed in the gun fight are yet to be identified.</p>



<p>Video footage from the capital on Wednesday showed smoke billowing from several areas and sounds of gunfire, though it&#8217;s unsure if this was related to the police sting.</p>



<p>Interim Prime Minister Clause Joseph said President Moïse was shot dead by a group of &#8220;foreigners who spoke English and Spanish&#8221; who disguised themselves at US Drug Enforcement Agency agents.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister declared a two-week &#8220;stage of siege&#8221;, imposing martial law, which has seen the Caribbean nation&#8217;s borders sealed and all flights out of Port-au-Prince halted.</p>



<p>Neighbouring Dominican Republic troops have amassed along Haiti&#8217;s land border.</p>



<p>Video has emerged showing gunmen allegedly posing as DEA agents storming the politician&#8217;s home before he was shot dead in front of his terrified wife.</p>



<p>The dramatic footage shows a series of cars rolling towards Moïse&#8217;s house as other armed gang members follow on foot.</p>



<p>Just moments later the premier<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15517735/haiti-president-jovenel-moise-assassinated/"> was gunned down</a> in what has been branded a &#8220;hateful, inhumane and barbaric act&#8221;.</p>



<p>The First Lady, Martine Moïse, is fighting for her life after being shot multiple times in the attack.</p>



<p>The 47-year-old has since been flown to Florida and taken to Baptist Hospital in Miami for treatment, where she is in a stable but critical condition, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/07/1014022342/4-suspected-killers-of-president-jovenel-moise-have-been-slain-2-arrested?utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;t=1625709364111&amp;t=1625729186297">NPR</a>.</p>



<p>She received gunshot wounds to her arms and thigh and further injuries to her stomach and hand, <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/07/first-lady-of-haiti-martine-moise-arrives-in-south-florida-for-treatment-after-being-shot-multiple-times/">WPLG-TV</a> report.</p>



<p>CCTV footage has now emerged showing at least three cars slowly driving towards the President&#8217;s home, flanked by gunmen.</p>



<p>Four people &#8211; reportedly mercenaries &#8211; can then be seen moving in formation following the cars while brandishing weapons.</p>



<p>Residents of the neighbourhood reported hearing massive gunfire and seeing men dressed in black running through the streets last night.</p>

<p>One high-ranking Haitian government official told the paper &#8220;these were mercenaries&#8221;.</p>



<p>The President&#8217;s death will likely throw the country into further chaos as the country becomes more politically polarised and with 59 percent of the population living below the poverty line.</p>



<p>In recent years, the small Caribbean country has been plagued by natural disasters and cycles of violence and economic turmoil.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister of Haiti confirmed the attack and said that a group stormed the private residence of President Moïse and shot him dead.</p>



<p>It has been reported that the president was killed at his home in the capital of Port-au-Prince at 1am.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Joseph&#8217;s statement said: “A group of individuals who have not been identified, some of whom were speaking Spanish, attacked the private residence of the President of the Republic and fatally injured the Head of State.&#8221;</p>



<p>The president was 53 years old.</p>

<p>In February, opposition politicians nominated their own president in an effort to drive out Moise whose five-year term had expired.</p>



<p>Joseph Mécène Jean-Louis, 72, a judge, said that he accepted the nomination. </p>



<p>Moïse insisted his term in office ended in February 2022 &#8211; a claim accepted by the United States.</p>



<p>In a statement today, the U.S Embassy in Haiti said that it would be closed to due to an &#8220;ongoing security situation&#8221;.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden will be briefed on the &#8220;tragic attack&#8221;, the White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.</p>



<p>Boris Johnson said the assassination of Moïse was an &#8220;abhorrent act&#8221; and appealed for calm in the country.</p>

<p>Streets were empty this morning after Haitians woke up to the news of the death of their President.</p>



<p>The country&#8217;s main airport was closed except for humanitarian and dipliomatic flights, the airport&#8217;s director general said.</p>



<p>On February 7, the day his presidential term was supposed to end, Mr Moïse claimed that a coup had been foiled to overthrow his government and kill him.</p>



<p>A total of 23 people were arrested including a senior police officer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thank my head of security at the palace,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life. That plan was aborted.&#8221;</p>



<p>During his time in office, Moïse was accused of corruption and was faced with waves of anti-government protests.</p>

<p>Demonstrations took place and there were clashes with police but residents of the capital, largely stayed at home.</p>



<p>In June, gangs raided multiple police stations in Port-au-Prince as violence between armed groups flared which forced thousands to flee.</p>



<p>Attackers raided six police stations and killed three officers burning their bodies in one attack, local media reported.</p>

<p>A TOP crime reporter is fighting for life after being shot in a suspected revenge hit. </p>



<p>Award-winning Dutch journalist Peter R de Vries is thought to have been targeted by mobsters he had exposed.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old was shot in the head in a street near a large public square in Amsterdam on Tuesday evening after a TV studio appearance nearby.</p>



<p>He was critically ill in intensive care last night.</p>



<p>Police arrested two suspects, a Pole, 35, and a 21-year-old Dutchman, after a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14702904/smart-motorways-to-stay-hard-shoulders/">motorway</a> chase.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13711470/tourists-ban-amsterdam-cannabis-cafes-drugs-tourism/">Amsterdam mayor Femke Halsema</a> said: &#8220;Peter R. de Vries is for all of us a national hero, an unusually courageous journalist, tirelessly seeking justice.<br>&#8220;Today, justice in our country appears a long way off. A brutal, cowardly crime has been committed.&#8221;</p>

<p>AFGHAN women have taken to the streets with machine guns and rocket launchers telling troops that they’re “ready to fight the Taliban”.</p>



<p>It comes as the terror group has <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15467931/afghanistan-isis-taliban-seize-us-military-vehicle/">unleashed a reign of terror in recent weeks</a> and has seized control of a quarter of Afghanistan.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15527398" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 900px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664434475.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=890" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15527398" width="890" height="534" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Twitter</figcredit></figure>Women have taken up guns in Afghanistan[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15527376" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000287226675.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15527376" width="960" height="677" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>Zarmina Ahmadi, 22, a female soldier from the Afghan National Army[/caption]



<p>The people of Afghanistan now face being plunged back under the Taliban&#8217;s brutal rule &#8211; with strict versions of Islamic law and punishments such as beheading and torture.</p>



<p>But the country’s women are now taking a stand &#8211; with hundreds flooding the streets of provinces across the country brandishing guns and chanting anti-jihadi slogans.</p>



<p>Halima Parastish, the head of the women’s directorate in Ghor and one of the marchers told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/07/armed-afghan-women-take-to-streets-in-show-of-defiance-against-taliban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>: “There were some women who just wanted to inspire security forces, just symbolic, but many more were ready to go to the battlefields.</p>



<p>“That includes myself. I and some other women told the governor around a month ago that we’re ready to go and fight.”</p>



<p>It comes as Taliban forces recently banned women from leaving the house alone and new dowry regulations &#8211; an amount of property or money brought by a bride to her husband on their marriage &#8211; have been brought in for girls.</p>



<p>And in one area where the terror group has taken control it’s been reported that flyers demanding that women wear burqas have been circulating.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15527342" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664434485.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15527342" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>A female Afghan special force commando unit officer attends a graduation ceremony at the military academy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on 31 May 2021[/caption]



<p>Another woman, in her early 20s, said: “No woman wants to fight, I just want to continue my education and stay far away from the violence but conditions made me and other women stand up.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added:&nbsp; “I don’t want the country under the control of people who treat women the way they do. We took up the guns to show if we have to fight, we will.”</p>



<p>Taliban forces previously imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule on Afghans before they were ousted after the US-led invasion in 2001.</p>



<p>Girls were barred from school and women were banned from working outside the home or being seen in public with a male relative.</p>



<p>And those who broke the rules faced floggings, beheadings, hangings, and crucifixions.</p>



<p>But the last US forces <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15463538/us-military-leaves-bagram-airfield-afghanistan-troops-biden/">left Afghanistan&#8217;s Bagram airfield on Friday after 20 years</a> in the war-torn region.</p>



<p>And some experts fear the withdrawal of American troops risk leaving behind a nation on the verge of disaster.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">


			<div>
<p>US forces have begun a full withdrawal from Afghanistan under the orders of US President Joe Biden after spending 20 years fighting to stablise the war-torn nation.</p>
<p>Some 456 British soldiers and 2,420 Americans &#8211; along with hundreds of other coalition troops &#8211; died during the war which was sparked by the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And the civilian casualties are estimated to have been almost 50,000.</p>
<p>Codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom, the US led an invasion off Afghanistan to oust the Taliban after al-Qaeda flew planes into the World Trade Centre and other US buildings in 2001.</p>
<p>The mission was to oust the Taliban, who were said to be harbouring terrorists and providing them a safe haven &#8211; including Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>What followed was nearly 20 years of grinding conflict as the US, its allies, and the Afghan security forces staged a grinding campaign to attempt to rebuild the country and beat back the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Taliban had ruled most of Afghanistan following the Afghan Civil War in the 90s &#8211; sparked by the withdrawal of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Western nations had actually supported the Taliban in the 80s as the ran an insurgency against the Soviet backed regime of Mohammad Najibullah.</p>
<p>However, after seizing power in 1996 &#8211; the Taliban brutally ruled Afghanistan and offered a safe haven to terrorist killers like Osama.</p>
<p>As the US war rolled on into the 2010s, Bin Laden was killed in May, 2011, in a US special forces raid in Abbotabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p>And since then there has been a slow withdrawal, with British troops officially ending combat operations in October 2014.</p>
<p>February 2020 saw a peace deal signed between the US and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, which agreed to a withdrawal &#8211; whoever the Afghan government criticised it as being done behind &#8220;closed doors&#8221;.</p>
<p>Taliban forces have since continued their operations and have been gaining ground &#8211; and the US continues to pull back its troops.</p>
<p>The war is seen as defeating the Taliban and improving the lives of the Afghan people who were once living under strict Islamic law and who now have free elections.</p>
<p>However, for some it is unfinished job which was mishandled &#8211; and that may 20 years on simply see a return to the dominance of the Taliban as they did pre-9/11.</p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander joint forces command, told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/flag-lowering-ceremonies-mark-end-of-operations-in-afghanistan-dmg8w2q9b">The Times</a> that Afghanistanis at &#8220;grave risk of collapse&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;We might argue that much more money, many more soldiers and a lot more time could have helped Afghanistan settle into a peaceful, modernising state — but that is academic: we are walking away from fighting for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>And it is feared the nation could become a new haven for terrorist forces wanting to strike out against the West, with The Sun Online revealing concerns new <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15420504/taliban-training-camps-afghanistan-west/">training camps could be operational by September</a>.</p>

<p>Professor Anthony Glees, from the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said the Taliban are now &#8220;back with a vengeance&#8221;.</p>



<p>Vile atrocities committed by the Taliban are well documented &#8211; in particular by ISIS who may seek to establish vile rule over parts of Afghanistan like they did in Iraq and Syria.</p>



<p>The Taliban said it &#8220;welcomes and supports&#8221; the decision by the US and NATO to withdraw.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[






<p>HAITIAN president Jovenel Moïse was assassinated and his wife, Martine, was wounded in their home on Wednesday, July 7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Haiti&#8217;s capital city of <a href="http://the-sun.com/where/haiti">Port-au-Prince</a> is mourning after the <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3234653/jovenel-moise-assassination-latest-updates-haiti-president-gunmen-live/">news</a>.</p>



<p><strong><em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f535.png" alt="🔵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Read our&nbsp;Haiti President assassination&nbsp;blog for the latest updates</em></strong></p>



<figure id="attachment_15526033" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664333076.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15526033" width="960" height="637" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Jovenel Moïse and Martine Moïse[/caption]



<h2>Who is Martine Moïse?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Martine was born on June 5, 1974 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</p>



<p>She met her husband, Jovenel, while both were students at Quisqueya University and got married in 1996.</p>



<p>During her time as first lady, she served as president of the Fondasyon Klere Ayiti, a community development organization focused on civic education and women&#8217;s issues.</p>



<p>In October 2017, she became president of coordination for Global Fund in Haiti aimed to alleviate <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/hiv-and-aids/">HIV/AIDS</a>, malaria and other public health issues in Haiti.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martine also advocated new investments in the Haitian arts and crafts industry in an effort to boost local artisans.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15527053" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 649px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664319628-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=639" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15527053" width="639" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>Martine was rushed to the General Hospital of Port-au-Prince following the attack[/caption]



<h2>What happened to Martine during the assassination?</h2>



<p>Moïse&#8217;s home was reportedly attacked at around 1am Wednesday by an armed group who allegedly claimed to be agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>



<p>Martine was allegedly shot at their residence in Pétion-Ville.</p>



<p>She was rushed to the General Hospital of Port-au-Prince following the attack.</p>



<p>Sources reported her death from her injuries later that morning, however, Haiti’s ambassador, Bocchit Edmont, said that Martine is in critical, but stable condition.</p>



<p>She landed in Florida Wednesday for emergency medical treatment.</p>



<p>She was airlifted to Fort Lauderdale where she will be transferred to Miami for treatment in Baptist Hospital, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/07/first-lady-of-haiti-martine-moise-arrives-in-south-florida-for-treatment-after-being-shot-multiple-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Local 10 News.</a></p>



<p>The first lady was pictured being taken from a small plane on a stretcher at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport at around 3.30pm.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15527054" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664400087.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15527054" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>&#8216;The whole area was under attack, gunfire everywhere, it was total panic&#8217;[/caption]



<h2>Who killed Haiti&#8217;s president?</h2>



<p>The assassination of the Haitian president was part of a “highly coordinated attack by a highly trained and heavily armed group,&#8221; Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said in a statement.</p>



<p>He has vowed to bring responsible to justice. </p>



<p>Joseph said in televised remarks after chairing a cabinet meeting that the government had declared a two-week <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3235621/president-jovenel-moise-us-embassy-haiti-lockdown/">state of emergency.</a></p>



<p>&#8220;My compatriots &#8211; remain calm because the situation is under control,&#8221; Joseph said in his address.</p>



<p>&#8220;This blow has wounded this country, this nation, but it will not go unpunished.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Haitian ambassador to the United States, Bocchit Edmond, said the attack &#8220;was carried out by foreign mercenaries and professional killers &#8211; well orchestrated&#8221; and they were masquerading as DEA agents.</p>

<p>THIS is the dramatic moment an &#8220;oil tanker&#8221; explosion sent flames shooting into the sky in a towering inferno.</p>



<p>The explosion at Jebel Ali Port in Dubai was heard several miles away with the glass in many buildings close by being shattered due to impact, according to reports.</p>

<p>A Tweet from Dubai&#8217;s state-run media office said that a fire was reported to have erupted on a ship and that a team of firefighters was working to control the blaze.</p>



<p>Two fire trucks and other emergency vehicles could be seen heading south of Dubai on the main road that leads to Abu Dhabi, Reuters reported.</p>



<p>Authorities posted a video of firefighters dousing giant shipping containers. Flames could be seen rising in the background as emergency services hosed down the area.</p>



<p>People in Dubai recording with their phones from their high-rises posted frantic videos on social media showing a fiery ball illuminating the night sky.</p>



<p>The fire has now been brought under control and no injuries have yet been reported.</p>



<p>DP World, which owns Jebel Ali Port, had no immediate comment when contacted.</p>



<p>The Jebel Ali Port in Dubai is one of the largest in the world and the largest in the Middle East. </p>



<p>It serves cargo from the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Asia. </p>



<p>The port, operated by the Dubai-based DP World, has four sprawling container terminals that can berth some of the world&#8217;s largest ships.</p>

<p>A LEONARDO da Vinci drawing valued at £10million has been discovered after lying buried in a box for decades.</p>



<p>The small pen-and-ink drawing is now at the center of a battle between its owner and France&#8217;s culture ministry that is playing out in a Paris court.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15523851" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664125674.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15523851" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>The drawing shows martyred Saint Sebastian tied to a tree[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15523855" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664125091.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15523855" width="640" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>It has been buried in a box for more than 60 years[/caption]



<p>The court will hear if the drawing of a martyred Saint Sebastian tied to a tree is allowed to leave France for eventual purchase by a foreign buyer, according to<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210707-sale-of-rare-leonardo-drawing-triggers-legal-battle-in-france"> France24.</a></p>



<p>The masterpiece was uncovered by a man named John B, who is in his 80s and received the drawing from his dad as a gift for passing his medical school exams in 1959.</p>



<p>The doctor had left it in storage among several other drawings for more than 60 years before he came across it while moving house in 2016.</p>



<p>Jean then decided to get them valued by the Tajan auction house, and he was told they were valued at between £20,000 and £25,000.</p>



<p>However they were soon inspected by two other experts, Patrick de Bayser and Carmen Bambach of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York who realised that the drawing was done by Leonardo.</p>



<p>The value of the small drawing then soared to between £6.8million and £10million.</p>



<p>But the French government sooned stepped in, saying that the drawing is a “national treasure” and that it would be acquired by the Louvre museum.</p>



<p>But their bid for the rare artwork fell short of Jean B’s hopes as they offered just £8.5million &#8211; which he refused.</p>

<p>Now Jean is fighting for a license for an export permit so he can sell the drawing to a foreign buyer &#8211; but the culture ministry has refused, claiming that the drawing may in fact have been stolen.</p>



<p>Jean B.&#8217;s lawyer Olivier Baratelli slammed the government&#8217;s handling of the painting&#8217;s discovery as &#8220;catastrophic&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;A culture ministry worthy of its name would have ensured the French state acquire such a drawing,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>A DAD has revealed the incredible moment that he won £500,000 on the lottery &#8211; after initially believing it was a hoax.</p>



<p>The lucky father, who held the only winning ticket in the Lotto draw, said he was initially skeptical after receiving nuisance calls in the weeks prior.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15523493" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000515572625.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15523493" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Crispin Rodwell - The Sun Dublin</figcredit></figure>The man scooped the huge prize in the Australian lotto[/caption]



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australian</a> man, who wished to stay anonymous, told <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/sydney-man-wins-1m-lotto-jackpot-while-walking-his-dog/news-story/4618ed72075bce09c0a113d2ed4e4d2a">news.au</a> that he was heading home after taking his dog for a walk when he received the life changing call.</p>



<p>“Did you say you’re calling from The Lott? This better not be a hoax,” he recalled telling the phone operator. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have been receiving a lot of nuisance calls lately. I hope this isn’t another one of those, because this would be great if what you are telling me is true.”</p>



<p>After the Lotto employee clarified that the man was indeed the lucky winner of the $1million (£542,000) jackpot, he said the news had left him &#8220;shell shocked.&#8221; </p>



<p>“A millionaire – I can’t believe it. “This is crazy. It’s a dream come true,” he said.</p>



<p>“I just sent a photo to my family of the win and they can’t believe it either. I can imagine the kids are already writing their wish lists.”</p>



<figure id="attachment_15523490" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000654351758-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15523490" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy</figcredit></figure>His winning numbers were 7, 34, 22, 44, 15 and 19, while the bonus numbers were 17 and 4[/caption]



<p>His wife also reportedly joined the call and joked there’s no way they’re getting a divorce anymore.</p>



<p>“And there’s no way I am leaving my husband now he’s a millionaire. I am writing my wish list now too,” she said.</p>



<p>The new winner also told the outlet that he plans to share his prize with his family, renovate his home and go on some holidays.</p>



<p>But, he admitted he wanted to be sensible with his winnings and seek financial advice.</p>



<p>“I need time to really plan what I am going to do,” he said.</p>



<p>“Most of it will be spent on the kids, which I am sure they will be very happy about.</p>

<p>Professor Robert Fatton, who has written several books on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/haiti/">Haiti&#8217;s</a> turbulent history, grimly said the situation is likely to &#8220;degenerate&#8221; and the country to be &#8220;plunged into chaos&#8221;.</p>



<p>And he said there could another military intervention as has previously been seen in the last few decades from France and the US with the backing of the United Nations. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15517735/haiti-president-jovenel-moise-assassinated/">President Moïse&nbsp;was gunned down</a> last night by a group of suspected mercenaries who are reported to have been posing as agents from the US Drug Enforcement Adminstration.</p>



<p>The group &#8211; one of whom spoke with an American accent &#8211; executed the President, 53, in his private residence at 1am, while the First Lady was also injured in the attack.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBw8n-N3i4k">France24</a>. Professor Fatton said: &#8220;I assume foreign powers will be very worried about this situation in Haiti, in particular the United States.</p>



<p>&#8220;And as we know in the previous 20 or 30 years, the UN and United States &#8211; and actually France &#8211; have sent troops to Haiti because of political uncertainty and instability.</p>



<p>&#8220;If things get bad &#8211; I would assume you would probably have another intervention.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, he went on that Haitians may push back against such an operation as many actually blame the US and other foreign powers for their current troubles.</p>



<p>Professor Fatton added: &#8220;We don&#8217;t know what is going to happen &#8211; we can only assume things will probably degenerate given the lack of security, the weak police and the rise of gangs in cities. </p>



<p>He went on: &#8220;It may plunge the country into chaos and talking to some people from Haiti there is a feeling it might also provoke a foreign occupation.&#8221;</p>

<p>US troops previously intervened to oust a military regime from Haiti in 1994 in a mission called Operation Uphold Democracy that lasted six months &#8211; before the reigns were handed to UN peacekeepers. </p>



<p>And again in 2004 French and US troops also moved in amid further political unrest which led to another coup. </p>



<p>It saw another UN peacekeeping force installed to try and control the worst of the violence &#8211; with a general election occurring in 2006. </p>



<p>However, the peace was short-lived and ever since Haiti has been rocked by disasters, protests, violence, disease outbreaks, food shortages and allegations of corruptions. </p>



<p>The killing of President Moise the latest horrific incident in the country&#8217;s troubled history.</p>



<p>Since a revolt which secured its independence in 1804, it has gone from being a French colony, to being occupied by the US in the early 20th century, to then being buffeted between dictatorships and military juntas. </p>

<p>It has been reported that the president was killed at his home in the capital of Port-au-Prince at 1am.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Claude Joseph&#8217;s statement said: “A group of individuals who have not been identified, some of whom were speaking Spanish, attacked the private residence of the President of the Republic and fatally injured the Head of State.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr Joseph condemned what he called a hateful, inhumane and barbaric act, adding that Haiti&#8217;s National Police had the situation under control.</p>



<p>Videos captured by people living in the same neighbourhood as the authorities suggested that the group claimed to be DEA agents</p>



<p>In February, opposition politicians nominated their own president in an effort to drive out Moise whose five-year term had expired.</p>



<p>Joseph Mécène Jean-Louis, 72, a judge, said that he accepted the nomination.</p>



<p>Moïse insisted his term in office ended in February 2022 &#8211; a claim accepted by the United States.</p>

<p>In a statement today, the U.S Embassy in Haiti said that it would be closed to due to an &#8220;ongoing security situation&#8221;.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden will be briefed on the &#8220;tragic attack&#8221;, the White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.</p>



<p>Boris Johnson said the assassination of Mr Moïse was an &#8220;abhorrent act&#8221; and appealed for calm in the country.</p>



<p>Streets were empty this morning after Haitians woke up to the news of the death of their President.</p>



<p>The country&#8217;s main airport was closed except for humanitarian and diplomatic flights, the airport&#8217;s director general said.</p>

<p>On February 7, the day his presidential term was supposed to end, Mr Moïse claimed that a coup had been foiled to overthrow his government and kill him.</p>



<p>A total of 23 people were arrested including a senior police officer.</p>



<p>&#8220;The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life. That plan was aborted,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>



<p>During his time in office, Mr Moïse was accused of corruption and was faced with waves of anti-government protests.</p>

<p>MYSTERY surrounds the case of a pregnant woman who was found dead with the baby missing from her womb.</p>



<p>Brazilian cops claim that the tot was not surgically removed and believe the 23-year-old gave birth naturally.</p>

<p>Thaysa Campos dos Santos, 23, was eight-months pregnant when she was found dead near a railway line in the neighbourhood of Deodoro in Rio de Janeiro last September.</p>



<p>Recently-accessed documents reveal the woman&#8217;s unborn baby girl was missing from her womb.</p>



<p>According to the post-portem the baby  was not surgically removed, suggesting that she was born naturally.</p>



<p>Thaysa was separated from the father of her two children, and the baby, due in October last year, was the result of a relationship with a married man.</p>



<p>The 23-year-old went missing on the night of September 3, last year and by the time her dead body was found on September, 10, it was already in a state of putrefaction.</p>

<p>According to Nelson Massini, professor of forensic medicine at Rio de Janeiro State University, the most likely scenario is that the baby was kidnapped.</p>



<p>The professor said Thaysa may have gone into labour while she was being murdered.</p>



<p>The victim&#8217;s mother, educational psychologist Jaqueline Campos, said: &#8220;I believe that my granddaughter may be alive and that Thaysa had a forced birth.</p>



<p>&#8220;My relatives were at the crime scene and there was no trace of the child there, just Thaysa&#8217;s body. I found out at the morgue that she had given birth.</p>

<p>A MISS Mexico beauty pageant has been plagued by a Covid-19 outbreak as half of the contestants test positive.</p>



<p>Eduardo Fernandez Herrea, the health secretary for the northern Mexico border state of Chihuahua, said 15 out of 32 women have caught the virus.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15521944" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664216934.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15521944" width="960" height="642" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>The girls were also told &#8220;not to complain&#8221; by organisers[/caption]



<p>Herrera told all the local media that the beauty queens all tested negative before the pageant.</p>



<p>According to sources inside the contest, the virus first began with participants from Zacatecas and Yucatan.</p>



<p>The source told Mexican newspaper Reforma that within a few days it had spread among the girls from Chihuahua, San Luis Potosi, Mexico City, Nuevo Leon, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Queretaro and others.</p>



<p>The girls were also told &#8220;not to complain&#8221; by organisers &#8211; despite most of them having a cough and a temperature.</p>



<p>Mass testing took place after authorities received an anonymous tip that one of the queens was infected.</p>



<p>Prior to the pageant, the contestants travelled to a school in the scenic Copper Canyon. </p>



<p>This was run by nuns for indigenous Tarahumara children. The models delivered school supplies and posed for selfies with students. </p>



<p>On the trip, a source told Reforma that “a minimum 10 [contestants] had symptoms”.</p>



<p>The event was cut short on Saturday after Karolina Vidales from the state of Michoacan was crowned as the winner and Mexico&#8217;s representative at the Miss World competition.</p>



<h2>THIRD WAVE</h2>



<p>Health officials in Chihuahua state accused the organisers of being uncooperative and attempting to cover up the rash of Covid cases. </p>



<p>The state health secretariat said in a statement it was tipped off on the outbreak by an anonymous call.</p>



<p>“The state health secretariat regrets the lack of honesty and transparency from the organising committee,” the statement said.</p>



<p>The country has recorded a total of 2,549,862 <strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/covid-19-8518">Covid</a></strong> cases and 233,958 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.</p>



<p>Mexico has entered the third wave of the pandemic according to Hugo Lopez-Gatell, the deputy health minister. </p>



<p>“We have a situation where there is a spike [in case numbers], the third of the pandemic and second of the year.</p>

<p>The woman was operating a tractor near the runway at the Saint-Esprit, 37 miles north of Montreal on Monday, when she was hit by the plane that was about to land. </p>



<p>Officials said she was rushed to the hospital but was pronounced dead.</p>



<p>Police&nbsp;spokesperson Marc Tessier told <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-woman-using-riding-lawnmower-struck-killed-by-landing-aircraft-1.5497279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CTVNews</a>: &#8220;The victim was on a tractor and she was hit by a plane that was landing.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was transported to the hospital where she was pronounced dead.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added that the pilot of the aircraft was also transported to the hospital and treated for nervous shock.</p>



<p>The incident is being investigated by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB). </p>



<p>A team was on site to interview witnesses and examine the aircraft and the tractor,<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/06/americas/canada-fatal-plane-accident-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> CNN</a> reported.</p>



<p>TSB spokesman Chris Krepski told the outlet that the aircraft  was a single-engine Nanchang CJ-6, a Chinese-built training plane that is usually flown by private pilots in Canada. </p>

<p>So-called “warning shots” were also fired from an FSB coastal patrol vessel.</p>



<p>In the latest incident Russia claims two Su-30 fighters prevented a Boeing P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine patrol aircraft of the US Navy from entering its airspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A video was released showing the aerial standoff, but the precise location was not divulged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;On the evening of July 6, Russian airspace control devices over the neutral waters of the Black Sea detected an air target approaching the state border of the Russian Federation,&#8221; said the defence ministry in Moscow on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two Su-30s were dispatched to identify the aircraft and prevent it entering Russian airspace, according to the Russians.</p>



<p>&#8220;The crews of Russian fighters identified the air target as a Boeing P-8 Poseidon and escorted it over the Black Sea.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15521071" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Two-Russian-Su-30-fighters-4-east2west-neews-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15521071" width="960" height="536" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The US Navy spy plane is seen in an image released by Russia</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>“The flight of Russian aircraft was carried out in strict accordance with international rules for the use of airspace.</p>



<p>“Violation of the state border of the Russian Federation was not allowed.”</p>



<p>There was no immediate comment from the US and no direct evidence that the plane had sought to encroach Russian airspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Royal Navy insisted that its warship was in international or Ukrainian waters off Crimea, annexed by Vladimir Putin from Ukraine in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Russian coastguard <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15369390/russia-uk-fires-warning-navy-ship-black-sea/">boat barked “change your course or I’ll fire”</a> at the massive Brit warship.</p>



<p>The Russian vessel opened fire twice &#8211; once at 12.06pm and again at 12.08pm &#8211; before the planes were ordered in.</p>

<p>&#8220;We did hear some firing in the distance but they were believed to be well out of range,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>Britain has vowed to continue using the route on future missions, provoking fury in Moscow.</p>



<p>Russia today said it was tracking a Spanish naval ship in the Black Sea amid NATO military exercises.&nbsp;</p>

<p>THIS is the brilliant moment a farmer harvests a field right next to apartment blocks after he blatantly refused to sell his land. </p>



<p>Footage shows the field which is surrounded by residential buildings, being harvested because Polish farmer Michal Myslowski did not sell his piece of land to the developers.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15520175" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664335654.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15520175" width="960" height="506" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Youtube</figcredit></figure>The field is surrounded by apartment blocks[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15520246" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664335695.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15520246" width="960" height="504" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Youtube</figcredit></figure>Farmer Michal Myslowski refused to sell his land to the developers[/caption]



<p>While most farmers &nbsp;in the city of Lublin agreed to sell their fields, a few others like Myslowski have refused.</p>



<p>This essentially means that he continues to harvest the crops as before &#8211; but they are now surrounded by apartments on Jantarowa Street.</p>



<p>Locals have praised the farmer for his decision and shared videos of him harvesting the field on social media.</p>



<p>Mr Myslowski told Polish outlet <a href="https://www.dziennikwschodni.pl/rolnictwo/lublin-zniwa-pod-oknami-blokow-w-okolicy-ciesza-sie-z-takich-widokow-a-rolnik-pozdrawia-mieszkancow,n,1000247431.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dziennik Wschodni</a>: &#8220;People are fine. They understand that I have work to do. They watch and make videos.</p>



<p>&#8220;The children are also happy. There have never been any problems with it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Local resident Katarzyna added: &#8220;As a resident, I can say that it does not bother us at all, on the contrary. Better such a view outside the window than being surrounded by concrete buildings.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another local added: &#8220;Some would give anything for such views.&#8221;</p>



<p>Many Twitter and Reddit users took it to social media to show their support. </p>

<p>Someone else added: &#8220;I&#8217;ve literally heard people swear that we don&#8217;t need cows because milk comes from the milk factory near their home, that we don&#8217;t need farmers because we import everything. </p>



<p>&#8220;Meanwhile the media and the government are destroying the farmers.&#8221;</p>

<p>SAMUEL Luiz was a 24-year-old man who was allegedly beaten to death in Galicia, Spain.</p>



<p>The attack was reportedly prompted by homophobia.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15519557" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 768px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664322941.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=758" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15519557" width="758" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Instagram</figcredit></figure>Samuel Luiz[/caption]



<h2>What happened to Samuel Luiz in Spain?</h2>



<p>Luiz was beaten to the point of death in the early hours of July 3, 2021, in A Coruña, Galicia.</p>



<p>Witnesses say the attack was allegedly motivated by homophobia, as Luiz was a gay man.</p>



<p>Luiz, who was a nurse, was leaving the El Andén nightclub when his assailants believed that he was recording them on his phone.</p>



<p>One in the group punched Luiz before the rest descended on him. Police described the brutal attack as a “human pack kicking a youngster for more than 150 meters down a street.” </p>



<figure id="attachment_15519559" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 911px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664322951.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=901" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15519559" width="901" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Instagram</figcredit></figure>Luiz, 24, was a nurse[/caption]



<p>The same sources added that “that they showed him no mercy,” with “between six and 10 people kicking him.”</p>



<p>Speaking to Spanish TV channel Telecinco, a friend of Luiz’s who was present when the assault took place, stated that one of the assailants shouted at the victim: “Stop recording us if you don’t want me to kill you, you f****** f**.”</p>



<p>“The man tried to escape on a number of occasions,” the police sources detailed. </p>



<p>“He fell and got up as many as three times, he managed to cross the street, but they caught up with him again and carried on beating him. There were a lot of people, men, and women, and they didn’t assault him but they did cheer on those who were,” until Luiz “definitively fell to the floor.”</p>



<p>Luiz later died from his injuries in hospital.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15519560" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664322944.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15519560" width="768" height="948" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Instagram</figcredit></figure>Luiz was tragically beaten to death in Galicia, Spain[/caption]



<h2>Are there any suspects in Samuel Luiz&#8217;s case?</h2>



<p>Spanish authorities have arrested three suspects in the case according to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2021-07-07/three-arrested-over-alleged-homophobic-killing-of-samuel-luiz-in-galicia.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">El Pais.</a></p>



<p>The police confirmed that the three people arrested are two men and a woman aged between 20 and 25, and residents of A Coruña.</p>



<p>As many as 15 people have already given a statement to the authorities about the crime,</p>

<h2>What did people say on social media about Samuel Luiz&#8217;s death?</h2>



<p>Protests have been sparked across Spain as a result of Luiz&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>The news has prompted global outrage on social media.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is Samuel Luiz, on Sat 3rd July he was beaten to death by a group of 12 men in Spain during <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pride?src=hashtag_click">#Pride</a> week. He was 24. Make no mistake, a fresh wave of LGBTQ+ hate is sweeping the world. This is why we march and why we never stop fighting. May he rest in power,&#8221; one user wrote.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fatal attack on Samuel Luiz is both sickening and terrifying. F***** should not be the last words anyone should hear. How are LGBTQ+ people still being killed in 2021?! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JusticeForSamuel?src=hashtag_click">#JusticeForSamuel</a>,&#8221; another posted.</p>



<p>In support of the protests, one penned: &#8220;Say his name! #SamuelLuiz.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know there’s ALOT going on right now but Would really like a statement from <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS">@POTUS</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/PressSec">@PressSec</a> on the murder of Samuel Luiz and the rise of LGBTQ hate crimes in Spain,&#8221; a user demanded.</p>

<p>Dilip Kumar will be remembered as a cinematic legend. He was blessed with unparalleled brilliance, due to which audiences across generations were enthralled. </p>



<p>As one of the country’s earliest method actors, he was often compared to Marlon Brando, another early adopter of the technique.</p>



<p>In his autobiography, he said: &#8220;I learned the importance of studying the script and characters deeply and building upon my own gut observations and sensations about my own and other characters.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paying tribute Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: &#8220;His passing away is a loss to our cultural world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan tweeted: &#8220;An institution has gone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whenever the history of Indian Cinema will be written, it shall always be before Dilip Kumar, and after Dilip Kumar.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kumar was born Muhammad Yusuf Khan, a Muslim, on December 11, 1922. </p>



<p>His Pathan family hailed from Peshawar, in what became Pakistan after Partition, and he visited his ancestral home in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>He changed his name as he debuted in Bollywood, the Hindi-language film industry centered in Mumbai, with Jwar Bhata, or Sea Tides, in 1944.</p>



<h2>CAREER SPANNED SIX DECADES</h2>



<p>His career spanned over six decades with over 60 films. His first major box-office hits were Jugnu, or Firefly, in 1947 in which he starred alongside Noor Jehan, and the 1948 film Shaheed, or Martyr.&#8221;</p>



<p>He played a variety of characters a romantic hero in Andaz, a swashbuckler in Aan, a dramatic drunkard in Devdas, a comic role in Azaad, a Muslim prince in the historical epic Mughal-e-Azam and a robber in the social movie Ganga Jamuna.</p>



<p>Mehboob Khans blockbuster Aan in 1952 was his first film in Technicolor and was among a string of light-hearted roles he took at the suggestion of his psychiatrist to shed his Tragedy King image.</p>



<p>He starred in many social drama films like Footpath, Naya Daur (&#8220;New Era&#8221;), Musafir (&#8220;Traveller&#8221;) and Paigham (&#8220;Message&#8221;) in 1950s.</p>



<p>His top female co-stars included Madhubala, Nargis, Nimmi, Meena Kumari, Kamini Kaushal and Vyjanthimala.</p>

<p>In 1966, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/15515923/who-is-dilip-kumars-wife-saira-banu/">Dilip Kumar married Saira Banu</a>, who was 22 years younger than him, and the couple acted in Gopi,&#8221; Sagina Mahato and Bairaag. They had no children.</p>



<p>In 1961, he produced and starred in Ganga Jamuna in which he and his brother Nasir Khan played the title roles. It was the only film he produced.

<p>He took a break in the late &#8217;70s but returned with a character role in the successful &#8220;Kranti,&#8221; or Revolution in 1981. He continued playing key roles in films such as Shakti, Karma and Saudagar. His last film was Qila (&#8220;Fort&#8221;) in 1998.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[






<p>AN eagle-eyed space-watcher has spotted at least ten small black objects hovering right below the International Space Station.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conspiracy theorist believes the NASA live feed captured the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/aliens-ufos/">UFOs</a> forming up in a circle above the Southern Atlantic Ocean.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15517940" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 643px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UFOJPG-CIRCLE.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=633" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15517940" width="633" height="850" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>YouTube/MrMBB333</figcredit></figure>The ISS camera captured a small fleet of roughly 10 objects &#8216;travelling&#8217; with the spacecraft[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15517702" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000196933671.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15517702" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>At least 10 small black objects flying right below the ISS camera as the craft was travelling above the Atlantic Ocean[/caption]



<p>Footage grabbed from the Nasa live stream from the International Space Station shows the orb-like objects moving past the camera.</p>



<p>UFO hunter &#8220;Mr MBB333&#8221; shared a screenshot taken by the space watcher captured on Saturday, July 3.</p>



<p>He posted the shocking discovery on YouTube, saying: &#8220;This is a screen grab from the International Space Station above the South Atlantic, at around 8.30am.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ten unknown objects travelling with the space station above the planet Earth.&#8221;</p>



<p>The video prompted UFO fans to dash to the ISS live feed before sharing their thoughts on the objects.</p>



<p>One said: &#8220;I just checked the ISS cameras and those little specks are still there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another wrote: &#8220;What it looks like to me is there&#8217;s a whole bunch of Black Knight probes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dismissed as a conspiracy theory for decades, ex-US defence officials, sitting politicians, and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have all acknowledged there is something unusual going on in our skies.</p>



<p>Speculation among UFO fans has been running rife as lawmakers and officials have hinted at potentially significant information compiled in the classified section of Pentagon&#8217;s landmark report on alien activity.</p>



<p>US officials released the highly anticipated public document after giving a secret briefing to Congress two weeks ago — but now everyone is asking, what is in the full version of the dossier?</p>



<p>It was commissioned after the Pentagon took the extraordinary step of confirmed a trio of stunning videos showing encounters with pilots &#8211; admitting they could not explain the phenomena. </p>

<p>Richard Dolan, an American historian who has researched the topic for 25 years, claims one of his sources provided him with details apparently in the section that was briefed to certain US Congressmen and US Senators.</p>



<p>He alleged the classified portion was 70 pages long and included information about advanced —and potentially alien — propulsion systems and experimental craft using the tech that are <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3221906/pentagon-classified-ufo-alien-area-51/">being tested at Area 51</a>.</p>



<p>However, he made clear the information was &#8220;unconfirmed&#8221;.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, UFO researcher and professor Bob McGwier claimed 14 videos were shown in the classified briefing — describing it as like a &#8220;science fiction movie&#8221;.</p>



<p>He claimed officials redacted everything they could from the report — which saw the public version slashed to just nine pages.</p>

<p><strong>THE President of Haiti was assassinated after a group of gunmen reportedly stormed his home posing as DEA agents.</strong></p>



<p>Residents of the neighbourhood reported hearing massive gunfire and seeing men dressed in black running through the streets last night.</p>

<p>The gunmen claimed to be agents with the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article252616688.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami Herald reports</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article252616688.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In one video</a>, filmed by a resident of the Port-au-Prince neighbourhood, a man with an American accent is heard shouting in English through a megaphone, &#8220;DEA operation. Everybody stand down. DEA operation. Everybody back up, stand down.”</p>



<p>But sources told the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article252616688.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper </a>that the group, one of whom spoke with an American accent, were not with the agency. </p>



<p>One high-ranking Haitian government official told the Miami Herald &#8220;these were mercenaries&#8221;.</p>



<p>The President&#8217;s death will likely throw the country into further chaos as the country becomes more politically polarised and with 59 percent of the population living below the poverty line.</p>



<p>In recent years, the small Caribbean country has been plagued by natural disasters and cycles of violence and economic turmoil.</p>



<p>The Prime Minister of Haiti confirmed the attack and said that a group stormed the private residence of President Jovenel Moïse and shot him dead.</p>

<p>It has been reported that the president was killed at his home in the capital of Port-au-Prince at 1am.</p>



<p>The first lady, Martine Moïse, was hospitalised after she was reportedly injured in the attack.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Claude Joseph&#8217;s statement said: “A group of individuals who have not been identified, some of whom were speaking Spanish, attacked the private residence of the President of the Republic and fatally injured the Head of State.&#8221;</p>



<p>The president was 53 years old.</p>



<p>Mr Joseph condemned what he called a hateful, inhumane and barbaric act, adding that Haiti&#8217;s National Police had the situation under control.</p>



<p>Videos captured by people living in the same neighbourhood as the President suggested that the group claimed to be DEA agents.</p>

<p>In February, opposition politicians nominated their own president in an effort to drive out Moise whose five-year term had expired.</p>



<p>Joseph Mécène Jean-Louis, 72, a judge, said that he accepted the nomination. </p>



<p>Moïse insisted his term in office ended in February 2022 &#8211; a claim accepted by the United States.</p>



<p>In a statement today, the U.S Embassy in Haiti said that it would be closed to due to an &#8220;ongoing security situation&#8221;.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden will be briefed on the &#8220;tragic attack&#8221;, the White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.</p>



<p>Boris Johnson said the assassination of Mr Moïse was an &#8220;abhorrent act&#8221; and appealed for calm in the country.</p>

<p>Streets were empty this morning after Haitians woke up to the news of the death of their President.</p>



<p>The country&#8217;s main airport was closed except for humanitarian and dipliomatic flights, the airport&#8217;s director general said.</p>



<p>On February 7, the day his presidential term was supposed to end, Mr Moïse claimed that a coup had been foiled to overthrow his government and kill him.</p>



<p>A total of 23 people were arrested including a senior police officer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thank my head of security at the palace,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life. That plan was aborted.&#8221;</p>



<p>During his time in office, Mr Moïse was accused of corruption and was faced with waves of anti-government protests.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15517272" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 807px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664283937.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=797" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15517272" width="797" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>Who is Saira Banu and what do we know about her?[/caption]



<h2>Who is Dilip Kumar&#8217;s wife Saira Banu?</h2>



<p>Saira is one of the most well-known actresses in Bollywood.</p>



<p>She was 16 years old when she started work on her debut Hindi film in 1960.</p>



<p>Banu then starting training as a dancer, and her films featured more of her dancing.</p>



<p>The couple met through family friends, and on them getting together she said: &#8220;Dilip saab thought I was still too young. And, he was always conscious that he&#8217;s a bit older to me. </p>



<p>&#8220;Not just that, he even felt that I was not heroine material as I was very shy and quiet.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was born on August 23, 1944, while her husband was born on December 11, 1922, making him 22 years her senior.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15515760/dilip-kumar-dead-bollywoods-marlon-brando/">Dilip passed away at the age of 98</a> on July 7, 2021.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15516625" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664266156.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15516625" width="960" height="641" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>Dilip Kumar and wife of 55 years Saira Banu[/caption]



<h2>When did Dilip Kumar and wife Saira Banu get married?</h2>



<p>Dilip and Saira married in 1966. </p>



<p>She was 22 and Kumar 44 years old at the time.</p>



<p>Kumar was one of the biggest names who dominated the golden age of Indian cinema from the 1940s to the 1960s, enjoying a career spanning more than 50 years and nearly 60 films.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15516676" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664234096.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15516676" width="960" height="638" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>Dilip Kumar and his wife Saira Banu pose on the red carpet at the premiere of the Hindi film Jab Tak Hai Jaan in Mumbai[/caption]



<h2>Do Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu have children?</h2>



<p>Kumar revealed in his 2014 memoir Dilip Kumar: The Substance And The Shadow that Banu became pregnant in 1972 but developed high blood pressure in her eighth month of pregnancy, and the doctors could not save the baby, which had been strangled by the umbilical cord. </p>



<p>After that, the couple decided against having children, believing that it was &#8220;God&#8217;s will&#8221;.</p>



<h2>What has Saira Banu said about Dilip Kumar&#8217;s death?</h2>



<p>Dilip was admitted to a non-Covid hospital on Tuesday, June 29, 2021. </p>



<p>In his final days, Saira told The Times of India: &#8220;It is out of love and not duress that I look after Dilip saab. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am not looking for praises to be called a devoted wife. </p>



<p>&#8220;Just to touch him and cuddle him is the world&#8217;s best thing that&#8217;s happening to me. I adore him and he is my breath itself.</p>



<p>Dilip died on July 7, 2021, with his doctor saying: “He passed away due to prolonged illness at 7.30am.” </p>



<p>On the news of his death, Saira said: &#8220;God snatched away my reason for living. Without Sahab I won&#8217;t be able to think about anything. Everyone, please pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>NINETEEN bodies were pulled out of the sea after a Russian plane smashed into a cliff — killing all 28 people on board.</p>



<p>A chilling video shows debris and personal possessions from the passenger aircraft scattered on coastal rocks after it crashed yesterday on its second approach to land  in bad weather.</p>

<p>Divers were at work in the hunt for remains of the nine other passengers and crew, said reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The search area was widened with a report that &#8220;the remains were carried a considerable distance out to sea&#8221;.</p>



<p>Searchers were coping with five-foot waves and strong winds as well as fog at the site. </p>



<p>The Soviet-era An-26 — constructed in 1982 — crashed into a coastal cliff by the Sea of Okhotsk en route from regional capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to the village of Palana.</p>



<p>Plane owners Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise has blamed extreme crosswinds for the crash but a full investigation is underway. </p>

<p>Russian reports have suggested pilot error or a technical malfunction could be behind the crash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Governor Vladimir Solodov said: &#8220;The first bodies are now being pulled out of the water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;In terms of the number of bodies, the situation is changing all the time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Divers were being called in to assist the recovery of bodies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr Solodov said: &#8220;The fuselage is located on this hill, and the main part of the plane (is) in the water.</p>



<p>&#8220;The place itself is inaccessible — a helicopter cannot land there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Charred foliage suggests the plane hit the top of a cliff on its second approach to land.</p>

<p>Mr Solodov said: &#8220;Specialists are being sent from Moscow to Palana to provide psychological assistance to the relatives of the victims.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also announced relatives would receive about £34,000 in compensation.</p>



<p>Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise will fly relatives to Palana for funerals. </p>



<p>Russian reports have suggested pilot error or a technical malfunction could be behind the crash. </p>



<p>Yesterday it was reported the plane was making its second attempt to land, but this was contradicted today by an account saying the An-26 was landing &#8220;normally&#8221;.</p>

<p>The plane’s flight certificate was due to expire on August 30.</p>



<p>Pilot Dmitry Nikiforovo, 34, was within five minutes of his allowed 70 hours when he took off, said one report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s state aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, said parts of the plane were found about three miles from the airport&#8217;s runway, near the coast line.</p>



<p>Part of the fuselage was found on a mountain side and another part was floating in the Okhotsk Sea.</p>



<p>Sergei Gorb, deputy director of Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise, said the plane practically crashed into a sea cliff, which was not supposed to be in its landing trajectory.</p>



<p>Among those on the plane was mother-of-three Yulia Surovtseva, 43, a university graduate in St Petersburg, who ran a puppet theatre in her village of Palana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another was Ekaterina Ponikarova, 30, who was returning home after a holiday.</p>

<p>The head of the Palana village administration, Olga Mokhireva, 42, was on the plane.</p>



<p>So were two Palana council officials, husband Alexander Andreykin, 44, head of the mobilisation department, and his wife, the head of the financial department, Olga Andreykina, 47.</p>



<p>A girl aged six, Alisa Khvaleyeva, 6, was on the plane, as was villager Artyom Tishchenko, 17.</p>



<p>Pictures emerged of crew members Alexander Anisimov, 27, co-pilot and&nbsp; graduate of the University of Civil Aviation in St Petersburg, Ivan Neverov, 31, the flight operator, and Rustem Zavgarov, flight mechanic.</p>



<p>Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin ordered a special commission to find out what had happened to the plane.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A criminal case was also launched into its fate, a normal measure when a plane goes missing or crashes in Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia, once notorious for plane accidents, has improved its air traffic safety record in recent years.</p>



<p>But poor aircraft maintenance and lax safety standards still persist, and the country has seen several deadly air accidents in recent years.</p>



<p>A hotline has been set up for relatives who will be offered psychological assistance.</p>



<p>The An-26&nbsp;that vanished today was a twin-engined&nbsp;turboprop&nbsp;civilian and&nbsp;military transport aircraft, designed and produced in the&nbsp;Soviet Union&nbsp;from 1969 to 1986.</p>



<p>In August, a&nbsp;South West Aviation&nbsp;An-26&nbsp;turboprop aircraft crashed while taking off from&nbsp;Juba Airport&nbsp;in&nbsp;Juba, South Sudan.</p>

<p>A month later an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12772202/military-plane-crashes-flames-ukraine/">An-26 hit the ground</a> while coming into land near the town of Chuguyev in the east of Ukraine, killing 22 of the 28 people on board. </p>



<p>The last major air accident in Russia took place in May 2019, when a Sukhoi Superjet belonging to the flag carrier airline Aeroflot crash-landed and caught fire on the runway of a Moscow airport, killing 41 people.</p>



<p>In February 2018, a Saratov Airlines An-148 aircraft crashed near Moscow shortly after take-off, killing all 71 people on board. </p>



<p>An investigation later concluded that the accident was caused by human error.</p>

<p>Russia also frequently experiences non-fatal air incidents that result in re-routed flights and emergency landings, usually stemming from technical issues.</p>



<p>In August 2019, a Ural Airlines flight carrying more than 230 people made a miracle landing in a Moscow corn field after a flock of birds were sucked into the engines shortly after take-off.</p>



<p>In February 2020, a Utair Boeing 737 carrying 100 people crash-landed on its belly in northern Russia after its landing system malfunctioned. All of the flight&#8217;s passengers and its crew survived.</p>



<p>Flying in Russia can also be dangerous in the vast country&#8217;s isolated regions with difficult weather conditions such as the Arctic and the Far East.</p>

<p>Fernanda Morella was enjoying her 33rd birthday when she accidentally fell at the heritage-listed the Kangaroo Point cliffs in Brisbane, Queensland.</p>

<p>Emergency services were called to River Terrace at 5pm yesterday after Fernanda, originally from Brazil, was found at the base of the rock-face.</p>



<p>Despite efforts by paramedics to revive her, she was pronounced dead at the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Queensland Police confirmed her family in Brazil have been informed of her death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tributes have begun pouring in online from devastated loved ones who have remembered Fernanda as a &#8220;loving person&#8221;.</p>



<p>One pal wrote: &#8220;I love you more than one day I could say. At the moment, you can only say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another friend said she was shocked and had received a message from Fernanda on her birthday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it! To what a sensitive and loving person. My friend fell yesterday when she saw the sunset and rested.</p>



<p>&#8220;She always called me, always loved me, always been present, wanted to be here for her birthday, and sleep here at home, but Sydney is closed and she wouldn&#8217;t be able to come.</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t talk much this week, but we always talk, every week we video call.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is believed to be an accident and it is not being treated as a suicide.</p>



<p>Kangaroo Point cliffs are a popular abseiling and rock climbing spot in the heart of the city alongside the Brisbane River.</p>

<p>A TEENAGE girl was gunned down by 10 men with rifles after she refused to marry her cousin in a horrific “honour killing”, reports claim.</p>



<p>The 18-year-old girl, said to be Eida Al-Hamoudi Al-Saeedo, is seen being shot in a disturbing video after she was taken to a desolate village on the outskirts of Al-Hasakah, a city in the north east of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/syria/">Syria</a>.</p>

<p>Eida is said to have tried to run away with her lover but her family and tribe followed her, according to <a href="https://www.akhbaralaan.net/news/arab-world/2021/07/04/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%BA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%B6%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%B6%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Akhabaralaan.net</a>.</p>



<p>The teen is dragged by three men who are carrying guns while she screams for help in the shocking footage.</p>



<p>The video, which The Sun Online has decided not to publish, then shows the other men, who are stood by a wall of an abandoned house, and three shots ring out.</p>



<p>Eida is then shown lying on the ground and appears to be struggling to get up when a man points a gun at her head and shoots her dead.</p>



<p>Her body is then covered with a red blanket.</p>

<p>Eida was shot in an “honour killing” after she fell in love with a young man and refused to marry her cousin, according to the <a href="https://www.syriahr.com/en/219018/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a> (SOHR).</p>



<p>The man is said to have proposed to Eida but her family forbid the marriage because he was from a different tribe.</p>

<p>It said: “SOHR strongly denounces this horrible crime calling for bringing the perpetrators on charges of murder and publishing the videos under the name of &#8216;honor crime&#8217;.”</p>



<p>The Violations Documentation Centre in northern Syria said Eida had been starved and beaten for a number of days before being executed by her family, who also identified Eida as the victim.</p>



<p>“[She was] brutally assaulted until the crime was completed by killing her with machine guns and pistols by more than one person,” a spokesperson for the center told the news site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The man who Eida fell in love with is said to have managed to escape from the tribe as the family “feared a reprisal” if he had been attacked.</p>



<p>The centre said in a Twitter statement: “Her sin was to love another man whom they couldn&#8217;t touch fearing of reprisal between the two families.”</p>

<p>The video has been widely condemned by activists and women’s groups who have called for the perpetrators to be prosecuted and for the killing of women to stop.</p>



<p>Writer Sameh Shukri said on Twitter: “A new crime of honor and racism against women, killing a Syrian girl in the city of #Hasakah for accusing her of love and adultery.&#8221;</p>



<h2>OUTRAGE OVER KILLINGS</h2>



<p>Just days after the video had been posted on social media a 16-year-old girl is said to have been killed by her father in another “honour killing”.</p>



<p>The girl was identified as Aya Muhammad Khalifo by the&nbsp;Violations Documentation Centre.</p>



<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the man strangled his daughter, who had been raped by a relative more than a year ago.</p>



<p>Hundreds of women took to the streets of Hasakeh on Tuesday to protest the “honour killings” with some wearing white t-shirts with the slogan ‘No to violence’ written in red on them.</p>



<p>The protesters gathered outside the home of the 16-year-old girl who was recently murdered.</p>



<p>Protester Evin Bacho, a member of the Kurdish feminist group Kongra Star said: “We condemn these crimes in the name of tradition or religion.”</p>

<p><strong>A TEENAGE boy attempted to rape a terrified 91-year-old woman after breaking into her home as she slept, it&#8217;s been alleged.</strong></p>



<p>The 16-year-old has been accused of smashing his way into the elderly pensioner&#8217;s home in Adelaide, Australia, shortly before midnight on Thursday.</p>

<p>Adelaide Youth Court heard how the teen &#8211; who cannot be identified for legal reasons &#8211; then forced himself onto the woman as she lay asleep in bed.</p>



<p>She then woke up and started screaming for help, allegedly prompting him to flee &#8211; leaving behind a trail of blood, reports <a href="https://7news.com.au/news/sa/adelaide-teenager-front-court-following-alleged-attempted-rape-of-elderly-edwardstown-woman-c-3320867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7News.</a></p>



<p>The alleged sex predator was arrested in city&#8217;s southern suburbs on Saturday afternoon by Special Crime Investigation detectives.</p>



<p>He was charged with aggravated serious criminal trespass and assault with intent to rape.</p>



<p>The victim has been left terrified and living in fear of another attack, the court heard, and is now living with family members.</p>



<p>When the teen appeared in court Monday, lawyers requested key details of the case be kept under wraps to prevent undue embarrassment for the accused&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>FEARS are growing for the British woman who vanished in Japan as her dad “anxiously waits by the phone”.</p>



<p>Alice Hodgkinson, 28, was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15497868/desperate-search-for-brit-woman-who-vanished-in-japan/">last heard from on June 30</a> in Kanagawa prefecture, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/japan/">Japan</a>, where she had been living.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15510756" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 625px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664127260.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=615" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510756" width="615" height="461" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>BPM</figcredit></figure>Alice&#8217;s dad said his daughter had been happy living in Japan[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15497971" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 531px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663919610.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=521" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15497971" width="521" height="678" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Facebook</figcredit></figure>Alice Hodgkinson hasn&#8217;t been seen or heard from since June 30[/caption]



<p>The teacher was reported missing when she failed to turn up for work.</p>



<p>Dad Stephen Hodgkinson last heard from her the day she disappeared and said she seemed well at the time.</p>



<p>He told the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/missing-woman-alice-japan-nottingham-5615755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nottingham Post</a>: &#8220;The last sighting of Alice was on June 29 and I heard from her on June 30 via email.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was no sign within the email that anything was wrong. It was a normal communication.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I can do and I am just waiting by the telephone for news at the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stephen, who lives in Bestwood Village, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/nottinghamshire/">Nottinghamshire</a>, said his daughter had left Nottingham last March to teach English in Tokyo and was happy in Japan.</p>



<p>In fact, she liked it there so much she decided to stay on for another year.</p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ROB-MAP-MISSING-ALICE-V3-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15498580" width="960" height="640" />



<p>Alice’s pals and work mates in Japan are said to be concerned over her disappearance and are doing all they can to help.</p>



<p>Stephen said: &#8220;There&#8217;s still no update or news.</p>



<p>&#8220;The police are in the process of issuing an official poster and her friends and work colleagues have also got together to make posters and are distributing them as widely as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>An appeal to find her has been made on social media by Alice’s brother Peter Hodgkinson.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;I know that the police went round to her home again today (July 5) so the investigation is continuing.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have Nottinghamshire Police setting up a link with the police in Japan over InterPol to deliver news and information to us, but this does take a few days to get setup.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15510765" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 625px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664127254.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=615" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510765" width="615" height="820" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>BPM</figcredit></figure>Stephen Hodgkinson said he was waiting by the phone desperate to hear news about his daughter[/caption]



<p>&#8220;The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office also have an incident logged.&#8221;</p>



<p>A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: &#8220;We are in contact with local authorities in Japan regarding a missing British woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alice is described as being around 5ft 6in tall and a picture shows her with shoulder-length blonde hair.</p>



<p>A spokesperson from Nottinghamshire Police said: “When a person goes missing who is originally from our area we will always seek to work with relevant authorities and support local families to try and trace them.”</p>

<p><strong>A YOUNG mum has died after becoming trapped inside a charity clothing bin as she desperately rifled through donations.</strong></p>



<p>Alarrah Lawrence, 33, was found hanging &#8220;half in, half out&#8221; of a clothing bank in Western Australia in a grim early morning discovery.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15510679" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 959px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664083925.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=949" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510679" width="949" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Facebook</figcredit></figure>Alarrah Lawrence, 33, was discovered trapped in a clothing bank in Western Australia[/caption]



<p>CCTV footage reviewed by cops shows the mum-of-one drive into Stockland Baldivis shopping centre in Rockingham at about 1.40am on Tuesday, before parking up and approaching the bin.</p>



<p>She then stood on a plastic bucket to boost herself up enough to look into the Good Sammys charity bin before starting to dig through clothing, the <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/disaster-and-emergency/alarrah-lawrence-body-found-in-stockland-baldivis-shopping-centre-charity-bin-identified-as-young-mother-ng-b881922368z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">West Australian</a> reports.</p>



<p>But the young mum is then believed to have slipped off the bucket &#8211; leaving the top half of her body stuck in the bin and her feet dangling out.</p>



<p>Tragically, Ms Lawrence wasn&#8217;t found until hours later when a member of the public spotted her hanging out of the bin after 5am, with clothing strewn across the floor under her feet.</p>



<p>Rockingham Detective-Senior Sergeant Andrew Elliott said analysis suggests she died from asphyxiation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Through our investigation so far it seems to be a non-suspicious death where a person has tragically died through very unfortunate circumstances,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems she became trapped and unable to remove herself from the bin.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added it would have been &#8220;very, very confronting&#8221; for the passerby who first found her.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15510711" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 949px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664083926.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=939" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510711" width="939" height="945" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Facebook</figcredit></figure>Police believe the young mum died from asphyxiation[/caption]



<p>Ms Lawrence&#8217;s heartbroken boyfriend hailed her his &#8220;soulmate&#8221; in a heartfelt tribute.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a cruel world,&#8221; he wrote on Facebook. </p>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re gone. I&#8217;m devastated and words can&#8217;t explain. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to miss you and I just wish I could tell you I love you one more time my soulmate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Floral tributes have been left at the scene, with friends and family describing Ms Lawrence, mum to a 15-month-old son, as a &#8220;pocket rocket&#8221; and &#8220;breath of fresh air&#8221;.</p>



<p>According to those living in the area, people are often seen rummaging through the charity banks in the early hours.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always clothes scattered around those bins,&#8221; one neighbour said.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why they&#8217;ve recently installed a CCTV camera and a light in the car park.&#8221;</p>

<p>SHOCKING footage shows surrendering Afghan troops hand over their weapons to the Taliban.</p>



<p>The country appears to have imploded after US forces fled their military bases, leaving behind thousands of the world&#8217;s most developed artillery. </p>

<p>Videos show Afghan soldiers relinquishing their American guns and the keys to their armoured cars. </p>



<p>In one clip shared on Twitter, the two sides shake hands and even hug as the apparently peaceful exchange is made. </p>



<p>Afghan military personnel told Taliban forces: &#8220;Forgive us for we were wrongdoers.&#8221;</p>



<p>The group appeared to welcome the apology, hugging the troops and responding saying: &#8220;No problems at all, have no fear.&#8221;</p>



<p>US General Scott Miller said he was shocked at how quickly the Afghan Army had given in to the Taliban, adding that &#8220;we should be concerned&#8221;.</p>



<p>He told ABC on Monday: &#8220;The loss of terrain and the rapidity of that loss of terrain has to be concerning. You look at the security situation, it&#8217;s not good. </p>



<p>&#8220;The Taliban are on the move. War is physical, but it&#8217;s also got a psychological or moral component, and hope actually matters. </p>



<p>&#8220;What you don&#8217;t want to have happen is that the people lose hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gloating Taliban insurgents have shown off their arsenal of brand new weapons abandoned by US troops. </p>



<p>The group&#8217;s fighters swiped shipping containers stashed full of guns and ammunition after American soldiers fled Afghanistan bases.</p>



<p>They nabbed 900 guns, 70 sniper rifles, 30 Humvees, 20 army pickups and 15 articulated military trucks &#8211; as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition &#8211; from the Sultan Khil military base in Wardak Province.</p>



<p>Grenades, mortars and satellite phones, with many labelled as &#8220;property of USA Government&#8221;, are also piled high, just days after the Taliban captured the base. </p>



<p>Footage taken by <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/the-taliban-are-making-gains-in-afghanistan-and-showing-off-their-progress-to-the-world-12348957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky News</a> shows AK47s and boxes of bullets lined up in rows alongside computers and printers in a nearby mosque.</p>



<p>The weapons, supplied by the US to the Afghan Army, are now ready to be used by the very group they were meant to be turned on. </p>

<p>One Taliban commander told the outlet: &#8220;Most of the time we don&#8217;t rely on all of this. We just rely on Allah.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it does help us alot and it has given us a lot of new weapons we can use in battle.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course we want peace, all people want peace here, but the government doesn&#8217;t want peace with us.&#8221;</p>



<p>The worrying footage comes as hundreds of American and Afghan soldiers attempt to escape Taliban forces as the group sweeps the country, leaving it on the verge of collapse. </p>



<p>US and NATO forces have almost completely pulled out of Afghanistan.</p>



<p>The Bagram Air Base, which housed up to 100,000 American military personnel at one stage, now sits empty after almost 20 years.</p>



<p>Military officials shared photos of the sprawling base, providing a rare first glimpse of what was the epicentre of America&#8217;s war to unseat the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15503875/afghan-looters-ransack-us-military-base/">Afghan looters ransacked the base</a> swiping laptops, speakers and guitars, as well as phones, small weapons and ammunition.</p>



<p>Most other Western forces have also left the country ahead of the September 11 withdrawal deadline.</p>



<p>Even <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15489598/taliban-surges-hundreds-soldiers-flee-afghanistan/">Afghan officials have been filmed fleeing</a> to Kabul, while at least 1,000 have <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15489598/taliban-surges-hundreds-soldiers-flee-afghanistan/">crossed the border into Tajikistan</a>.</p>



<p>Tajik President Emomali Rahmon said Afghan people were permitted to enter on the principle of &#8220;good neighbourliness&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he mobilised 20,000 military reservists to help bolster the border on Monday.</p>



<p>General Miller has warned <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a> is on the verge of &#8220;civil war&#8221; as Taliban militants have seized more than one third of the country. </p>



<p>&#8220;That should be a concern to the world,&#8221; he said.</p>



<h2>&#8216;CONCERN TO THE WORLD&#8217;</h2>



<p>Taliban forces have already seized hundreds of trucks, armoured vehicles and artillery from Afghan security forces, left by departing American forces. </p>



<p>In the month of June alone, the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15467931/afghanistan-isis-taliban-seize-us-military-vehicle/">militants captured 700 vehicles to be used in their bid to regain power</a> after being toppled by the America&#8217;s 2001&nbsp; invasion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on top of this, it is feared the nation could become a new haven for terrorist forces wanting to strike out against the West, with The Sun Online revealing concerns new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15420504/taliban-training-camps-afghanistan-west/">training camps could be operational by September</a>.</p>



<p>Professor Anthony Glees, from the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said the Taliban are now &#8220;back with a vengeance&#8221;.</p>

<p>Taliban forces were first overthrown in 2001 following a US invasion &#8211; but since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/us-news/14835496/hillary-clinton-afghanistan-withdrawal-anthony-blinken/">US President Joe Biden&#8217;s decision to withdraw</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15395994/taliban-seizes-afghanistan-blitz-offensive-us-20-year-war/">group has now gone on to seize one third of Afghanistan</a>.</p>



<p>And further offensives are expected throughout the summer with warnings the jihadi forces&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14937534/taliban-seize-district-kabul-afghanistan/">could take the capital of Kabul</a>&nbsp;within six months.</p>



<p>It is being described by concerned US intelligence officials as &#8220;the greatest jihadist victory since the Soviets quit in 1989&#8221;.</p>

			<div>
<p>US forces have begun a full withdrawal from Afghanistan under the orders of US President Joe Biden after spending 20 years fighting to stablise the war-torn nation.</p>
<p>Some 456 British soldiers and 2,420 Americans &#8211; along with hundreds of other coalition troops &#8211; died during the war which was sparked by the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And the civilian casualties are estimated to have been almost 50,000.</p>
<p>Codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom, the US led an invasion off Afghanistan to oust the Taliban after al-Qaeda flew planes into the World Trade Centre and other US buildings in 2001.</p>
<p>The mission was to oust the Taliban, who were said to be harbouring terrorists and providing them a safe haven &#8211; including Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>What followed was nearly 20 years of grinding conflict as the US, its allies, and the Afghan security forces staged a grinding campaign to attempt to rebuild the country and beat back the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Taliban had ruled most of Afghanistan following the Afghan Civil War in the 90s &#8211; sparked by the withdrawal of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Western nations had actually supported the Taliban in the 80s as the ran an insurgency against the Soviet backed regime of Mohammad Najibullah.</p>
<p>However, after seizing power in 1996 &#8211; the Taliban brutally ruled Afghanistan and offered a safe haven to terrorist killers like Osama.</p>
<p>As the US war rolled on into the 2010s, Bin Laden was killed in May, 2011, in a US special forces raid in Abbotabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p>And since then there has been a slow withdrawal, with British troops officially ending combat operations in October 2014.</p>
<p>February 2020 saw a peace deal signed between the US and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, which agreed to a withdrawal &#8211; whoever the Afghan government criticised it as being done behind &#8220;closed doors&#8221;.</p>
<p>Taliban forces have since continued their operations and have been gaining ground &#8211; and the US continues to pull back its troops.</p>
<p>The war is seen as defeating the Taliban and improving the lives of the Afghan people who were once living under strict Islamic law and who now have free elections.</p>
<p>However, for some it is unfinished job which was mishandled &#8211; and that may 20 years on simply see a return to the dominance of the Taliban as they did pre-9/11.</p>

<p>CHINA has sensationally claimed that Covid originated in America in a bid to shift the blame from Wuhan and said that &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; are bullying anti-lab leak scientists.</p>



<p>The nation has again pushed for an extensive investigation into tracing the virus back to the US and claimed international experts have been &#8220;threatened&#8221; to keep quiet. </p>



<figure id="attachment_15510185" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000594522774.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510185" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>China claims international scientists who don&#8217;t believe the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab are being &#8216;threatened&#8217;[/caption]



<p>The outlandish claims, published by Beijing&#8217;s communist newspaper the Global Times, suggest the US are &#8220;politicising the origin-tracing research&#8221; and putting scientists at the centre of a &#8220;political storm&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Prominent US and Australian scientists focused on the COVID-19 origins tracing are now facing tremendous political pressure, and some have been sidelined for not yielding to (the) politicians-driven conspiracy theory,&#8221; it said.</p>



<p>Beijing claims respected global virologists and medical experts, including Dr Anthony Fauci, have been subject to a witch hunt after suggesting Covid came from animals and was transmitted to humans.</p>



<p>The publication claimed the US infectious disease chief &#8220;has been a target of the GOP,&#8221; which they believe has prompted him to become &#8220;increasingly ambiguous on his rhetoric.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15510167" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000560836295.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510167" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>EPA</figcredit></figure>The nation has again pushed for further investigation into the idea Covid came from the US[/caption]



<p>The World Health Organisation originally also suggested animal transmission was the most likely source of the virus &#8211; but US intelligence recently suggested Covid was either intentionally or unintentionally leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>



<p>The ruling has rattled China, who waited with bated breath for the results of the 90-day-review into the source of the virus after President Joe Biden ordered the investigation back in March.</p>



<p>Biden said the &#8220;intelligence community has ‘coalesced around two likely scenarios’ but has not reached a definitive conclusion on this question.&#8221;</p>



<p>He requested they &#8220;redouble their efforts to bring us closer to a definitive conclusion,&#8221; with another 90-day deadline.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15510188" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000595712164.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510188" width="960" height="594" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Wuhan virologists believe the results of US research proves the virus emerged in America before it spread[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15510357" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/765013fe-17f0-47ef-9b1c-490cdd4b57db.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510357" width="960" height="618" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>President Biden has told US intelligence to &#8216;redouble their efforts&#8217; to gain a definitive answer on where Covid came from[/caption]



<p>Citing research analysing antibodies in over 24,000 stored blood samples across all 50 states from the US National Institute of Health, China claims the results suggest the virus was in America much earlier than reported.</p>



<p>The samples, taken between January 2 and March 18, 2020, found two positive cases from January 7 &#8211; which they suggest shows the virus was in the US from as early as December 2019, when Wuhan reported their first cases.</p>



<p>According to a Wuhan virologist, the research proved the &#8220;epidemic in the US probably emerged earlier than in Wuhan,&#8221; the Global Times reported.</p>



<p>&#8220;The US has nearly all the variants spreading around the world, based on this, the virus most likely originated in the US rather than the Wuhan lab,&#8221; it continued.</p>



<p>But authors of the National Institute&#8217;s report &#8220;noted several limitations to their study&#8221; such as the potential for false positives, queries whether and participants could have been &#8220;infected during travel or while in their own communities.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_15510183" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000560791727.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15510183" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AFP</figcredit></figure>The publication claimed experts are being silenced by threats from &#8216;white supremacists&#8217;[/caption]



<p>Among the other experts The Global Times alleged to have received death threats &#8220;if he continued expressing opinions on the origins of the virus&#8221; is an Australian scientist. </p>



<p>Most likely sent by people with &#8220;far-right and even white supremacism leanings,&#8221; they claimed he was told he &#8220;may face even further crackdown.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Global Times reported that another US scientist was being threatened by &#8220;emails, phone calls, and messages on social media&#8221; as part of a &#8220;coordinated political campaign to undermine anyone involved in the origins work if they do not fit the lab leak narrative.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press conference on Monday: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen many true scientists who uphold the truth-seeking spirit of science and an objective and just position being attacked and defamed by certain governments and radical forces, and even received death threats.&#8221;</p>



<p>The publication then continued to defend claims about the Wuhan lab Covid was thought to have leaked from and dismissed claims researchers from the lab were hospitalised in November 2019 with flu-like symptoms.</p>



<p>In January 2020, at least 430,000 people arrived in the US from China and over 4,000 people travelled from Wuhan before health screenings were introduced later in the month.</p>

<p>DISTURBING images have captured a 16ft crocodile swinging a catfish through the air as it savages its prey. </p>



<p>The beast tore the fish apart with such brute force its body was left in pieces &#8211; which were then gulped down in less than a minute. </p>



<figure id="attachment_15509926" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664048629.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15509926" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>mediadrumworld.com/@timdrimanmed</figcredit></figure>A 16ft crocodile devours a catfish in the Okavango Delta, Botswana[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15509925" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664048635.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15509925" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>mediadrumworld.com/@timdrimanmed</figcredit></figure>The beast thrashed the fish from side to side[/caption]



<p>In one image, the Nile croc is seen launching itself into the water while another shows it grabbing the fish wriggling with fright. </p>



<p>The next illustrates the moment the crocodile smashes the 26-pound catfish from side to side before decapitating it and leaving its body scattered across the swampy waterhole in pieces.</p>



<p>The images were taken by wildlife photographer Tim Driman.</p>



<p>He captured the vicious kill in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, from 82-feet away using a Sony A9i camera and a Sony 400mm lens.</p>



<p>The crocodile devoured its tasty treat whole in less than a minute.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15509921" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664048796.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15509921" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>mediadrumworld.com/@timdrimanmed</figcredit></figure>It gulped down its prey in less than one minute[/caption]



<p>Tim, from Ballito, South Africa, said: “I was on a trip to the Okavango Delta during a severe drought, where we came across a drying-out waterhole.</p>



<p>“As we edged closer, we spotted 64 Nile crocodiles of various sizes swimming around the edges and noticed that their movement pattern was in sync with some catfish.</p>



<p>“After seeing the abundance of crocodiles and catfish, I knew something intense was about to happen &#8211; so I got my camera ready.</p>



<p>“Within moments, one of the crocodiles dove underwater and I began tracking him using the bubbles which were rising to the surface of the water.</p>



<h2>&#8216;BRUTAL FORCE&#8217;</h2>



<p>“Just seconds later, the crocodile emerged with a giant catfish hanging out of its mouth and it threw the fish about from side to side.</p>



<p>“The crocodile had its jaws clamped firmly into the catfish’s body and after the crocodile was done smashing his prey with such brutal force, the fish had been torn to pieces and most of its body was scattered across the watering hole.</p>



<p>“After a few seconds, the catfish&#8217;s head was separated from the body and the crocodile flipped its tasty treat sideways and swallowed it whole.”</p>



<p>He added: “Normally, crocodiles only congregate when there is an ample supply of food and water which is why this area intrigued us as there were so many crocodiles all in one place, but no resources due to the drought.</p>



<p>“I knew that if we were patient, we would get action that day and I was absolutely elated after seeing this event pan out &#8211; as it’s always nice to see my patience being rewarded.”</p>

<p>BBC One&#8217;s High: Confessions of an Ibiza Drug Mule looks back on the drug trafficking case in a five-part true-crime docuseries about the pair&#8230;</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2981260" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2981260 size-thesun-article-image" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000026190689.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=720" width="720" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty Images</figcredit></figure> A customs picture showing the pair at the moment of their arrest[/caption]</p>
<h2>Who are Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid?</h2>
<p>Michaella McCollum was born in Dungannon, Northern Ireland, and Melissa Reid hails from Glasgow.</p>
<p>In 2013, McCollum was working as a part-time model and a nightclub hostess in Ibiza while Reid was a sales assistant back in Scotland.</p>
<h2>Why were they arrested?</h2>
<p>The pair were both 20 years old when they were arrested in August 2013 in Lima Airport.</p>
<p>They travelled to Peru on August 15 and were caught trying to leave the country with 11kg cocaine worth £1.5 million at Lima Airport just two days later.</p>
<p>They were caught by customs officers carrying the Class A drug ahead of a long-haul flight to Madrid, Spain.</p>
<h2>How much cocaine were they trying to smuggle?</h2>
<p>The pair had cut the drugs with bicarbonate of soda and starch, and concealed them inside porridge and jelly packets to mask the smell.</p>
<p>It was later reported they were <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1343747/peru-drug-mule-melissa-reid-admits-she-lied-to-police-and-commited-the-crime-to-impress-her-friends/">paid just £4,000 each to smuggle the drug</a>.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2981598" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2981598 size-thesun-article-image" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000025654166.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" width="960" height="666" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP:Associated Press</figcredit></figure> The drugs were concealed inside porridge and jelly packets[/caption]</p>
<h2>How long did they serve in prison?</h2>
<p>They faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind-closed-doors plea bargain to secure the shorter sentence.</p>
<p>When they appeared in court they<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10220804/peru-two-drugs-mule-michaella-mccollum-naked-cocaine-arrest/"> pleaded guilty</a> to drug smuggling and in December 2013 were sentenced to six years and eight months in prison.</p>
<p>They were held at the notorious Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima but were moved to Ancon 2 prison where they took up coveted positions <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1646692/drugs-mule-michaella-mccollum-speaks-on-peru-jail-nightmare/">training in beauty therapy in a bid to become hair stylists</a>.</p>
<p>Some reports claimed the girls were held in cells with 30 other prisoners.</p>

<h2>What did they say after their arrest?</h2>
<p>The girls at first <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1343747/peru-drug-mule-melissa-reid-admits-she-lied-to-police-and-commited-the-crime-to-impress-her-friends/">claimed they had been forced to carry the drugs by an armed gang</a>.</p>
<p>However, following her release Melissa admitted she knew what she was doing.</p>
<p>She confessed: &#8220;I made a conscious decision to do it and no one forced me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michaella also opened up, saying she was &#8220;stupid&#8221; to get seduced into making just £5,000 and thought Peru was a Spanish town.</p>
<p>In her book, she writes: &#8220;Was I guilty? Yes. Did I know what I was doing? Sort of. Was I hung out to dry by a bunch of gangsters and the Peruvian justice system? Absolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;So why did I do it? Why did I jeopardise everything and bring untold heartache to my adored family for a few easy quid?&#8221;</p>

<h2>When did they return home?</h2>
<p>In early 2016, both women made attempts to return to the UK.</p>
<p>McCollum applied to be freed on parole and was released on 31 March 2016, with the prospect of having to remain in Peru for up to six years.</p>
<p>In April, the Peruvian authorities <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1663628/drugs-mule-melissa-reid-gets-cosy-with-new-man-weeks-after-being-freed-from-peru-jail/">agreed to expel Reid from the country </a>and she was released from prison on 21 June and immediately returned home to Scotland.</p>
<p>McCollum returned home two months later, arriving at Dublin airport on 13 August 2016.</p>
<h2>What actually happened?</h2>
<p>Michaella said she began working as a waitress in Ibiza in 2013 serving up cocaine and ecstasy alongside gin and tonics on the notorious party island.</p>
<p>It was then she met a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10174257/michaella-mccollum-seduced-cocaine-peru-two/">Cockney dealer called Davey</a>, who asked her if she wanted to do a &#8220;run&#8221; for him &#8211; getting drugs from Spain and bringing them back to Ibiza.</p>
<p>Michaella said the cash offered played on her mind because she wanted more than the wages she was on working in a bar.</p>
<p>So when he asked her again if she would travel to Barcelona to pick up drugs, Michaella agreed.</p>
<p>In August 2013, she met a Colombian associate of Davey&#8217;s called Mateo, who told her she was instead now heading to Peru.</p>
<p>Michaella first <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10249689/michaella-mccollum-normal-drug-smuggling-peru/">flew to Majorca</a>, where she met her fellow drug mule &#8211; 20-year-old Melissa Reid from Lenzie in Scotland.</p>
<p>She was told she would catch up with Melissa a day later in Lima and the pair would visit tourist hotspots such as Machu Picchu as a cover.</p>
<p>Two days into the trip in Peru, Melissa received a phonecall and was instructed to take a large bag outside to meet the dealer.</p>
<p>But she was forced to take another bag to fit in the haul of cocaine, which was hidden in 31 sachets of porridge oats.</p>
<p>The pair divided the packets to carry in their suitcases.</p>
<p>The girls woke at 6am the next day and travelled to Lima airport.</p>
<p>But the gig was up when a plain-clothes police officer searched their bags.</p>

<h2>What are they doing now?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4884181/peru-two-michaella-mccollum-naked-cocaine-arrest/">Michaella</a> is now aged 26 and is a mother to<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10269195/drugs-mule-michaella-mccollum-reveals-she-was-transfixed-watching-lesbian-romps-while-behind-bars-in-peru/"> twins who were born last year.</a></p>
<p>She is not with the father of the two boys &#8211; but has said she knew she could raise her sons by herself.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing something I planned, it&#8217;s not how I envisioned things.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are my children and I love them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She released <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/4514033/peru-two-michaella-mccollum-autobiography/">a book You’ll Never See Daylight Again</a> and was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3149953/peru-two-drug-mule-michaella-mccollum-offered-250000-to-reveal-her-darkest-secrets-and-lift-the-lid-on-her-jail-hell/"> offered a whopping £250,000 for the tell all book.</a></p>
<p>She will appear in the new BBC docuseries to tell her side of the story.</p>
<p>Michaella confirmed on Lorraine that she is <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/2933721/michaella-mccollum-melissa-reid-peru-two-drugs/">&#8220;still in touch&#8221; with Melissa</a>.</p>
<p>Melissa has since retreated from the limelight.</p>

<p>TWO brothers tore down their family home in a bid to make sure their sister &#8220;doesn&#8217;t get a cent&#8221; of the estate after claiming she &#8220;killed their mother&#8221;.</p>



<p>Garry, 59, and Malcolm Taylor, 57, attacked the family property left to the siblings as inheritance the day before it went to auction, much to their own &#8220;amusement&#8221;.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15508330" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 529px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085055.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=519" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508330" width="519" height="301" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>Garry, 59, and Malcolm Taylor, 57, destroyed their late mother&#8217;s home in an inheritance row with their sister Kerrie, 61[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15508328" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085057.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508328" width="960" height="491" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>The pair filmed the unbelievable destruction in March 2019[/caption]



<p>The pair purposefully travelled from Hervey Bay in Queensland to Murtoa in Victoria in March 2019 to stop their sister Kerrie, 61, cashing in on the sale amid their outlandish claims she murdered their mother, Lois.</p>



<p>Despite having no basis for the claims, they filmed themselves gleefully destroying the property with an excavator as they would &#8220;rather pull it down piece by piece&#8221; than share the money with their sister.</p>



<p>They even taunted Kerrie with a text message reading, &#8220;The renovations have begun,&#8221; as they ripped through the walls of the ageing home, the Victoria County Court heard.</p>



<p>The youngest of the trio, Malcolm, called the real estate agent conducting the sale in November 2018, saying Kerrie had &#8220;killed his mother&#8221; and promised to &#8220;&#8216;continue to take items from the house until there was nothing left,&#8221; according to court docs.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15508359" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 521px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085052.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=511" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508359" width="511" height="304" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>The pair hired an excavator after travelling from Queensland for their own demolition project[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15508326" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 417px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085162.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=407" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508326" width="407" height="586" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>Malcolm allegedly daubed the sick taunt in spray paint on one of the bedroom walls[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15508319" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 418px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085159.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=408" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508319" width="408" height="589" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>The outline of a body was also drawn on the floor[/caption]



<p>The bitter family feud began after their mother Lois died in December 2013 after appointing Kerrie as the sole executor of her will. </p>



<p>The brothers were riled after being told their children would receive $10,000 in trust payments as part of the estate &#8211; sparking the &#8220;deep-seated&#8221; battle between the siblings.</p>



<p>The duo then went on a 30-minute &#8220;tirade of destruction&#8221; at the home armed with an excavator &#8211; destroying the foundations of the property, smashing windows, ripping down walls, and rolled a huge fibreglass water tank through the streets &#8211; as it was set to be sold.</p>



<p>Inside the home, Malcolm then allegedly daubed &#8220;Lois was murdered here,&#8221; in bright red spray paint across the wall in one of the rooms, before drawing the outline of a body on the floor. </p>



<p>He denied any knowledge of the graffiti in court.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15508358" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 529px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085050.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=519" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508358" width="519" height="299" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>The brothers gleefully filmed each other as they took aim at the property[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15508348" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 186px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085037.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=176" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508348" width="176" height="309" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>Malcolm seen rolling the huge water tank down the street before he dumped it at a large intersection[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15508321" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 642px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085160.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=632" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508321" width="632" height="374" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>Malcolm tore the gate from his late mother&#8217;s property to make way for the excavator[/caption]



<p>The property had been sold on December 12, 2018 &#8211; but intentional water damage saw the buyer pull out of the purchase before the settlement date.</p>



<p>It was then due to go under the hammer on March 29, 2019 &#8211; before Garry and Malcolm began their shocking spree of destruction.</p>



<p>A text message sent from Malcolm to Garry read, &#8220;I bet it don&#8217;t look like that at 12 noon Friday,&#8221; according to court docs.</p>



<p>Malcolm was later filmed removing the water tank attached to the house and rolling it down the street, as his brother manically laughed on, before dumping it on a large intersection in Murtoa.</p>



<p>They then took turns operating the excavator while the other one filmed each other taking their frustrations out on the family home. </p>



<p>Malcolm can even be heard yelling, &#8220;Charge!&#8221; as he rips into one side of the property.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15508317" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085158.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508317" width="960" height="528" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>The brothers laughed hysterically while tearing into the ageing home[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15508311" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 227px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085058.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=217" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508311" width="217" height="377" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>They ripped down walls, destroyed the foundations and smashed windows[/caption]



<p>The pair even delightedly took selfies inside the wreckage to commemorate their hard day&#8217;s work, before heading to the MCG to watch an AFL match.</p>



<p>They shared another snap from the sports ground alongside the caption, &#8220;Few beers at the footy after a hard days renovating.&#8221;</p>



<p>A neighbour called the police on the vandals, who arrived to find the pair leaving the house on the morning of March 28.</p>



<p>Garry told Leading Senior Constable Michael Baldock they &#8220;had to make sure them (sic) renovations were right before tomorrow.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are both tradesmen but we&#8217;re f**king rough,&#8221; he said to Baldock.</p>



<p>Both Garry and Malcolm were arrested the following morning before they could fly back to Queensland, where cops found Malcolm in possession of eight grams of marijuana.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15508314" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 643px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085153.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=633" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508314" width="633" height="366" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>They didn&#8217;t want their sister to &#8216;get a cent&#8217; from the house sale after claiming she&#8217; had killed their mother&#8217;[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15508343" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 188px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664085039.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=178" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508343" width="178" height="311" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Supplied</figcredit></figure>Two purchases of the property fell through thanks to intentional damage[/caption]



<p>He told cops it was just &#8220;a little bit of dope, enough to roll a joint&#8221; that he used to help him sleep.</p>



<p>The brothers were charged with damaging property and theft, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail, while Malcolm was also slapped with charges for drug possession and an additional theft.</p>



<p>They both pleaded guilty to criminal damage charges.</p>



<p>Judge Michael Cahill said the brothers&#8217; actions had &#8220;an entirely irrational response,&#8221; according to the Herald Sun, as ruining their sister&#8217;s sale saw them lose a combined $60,000.</p>



<p>&#8220;Family disputes bring out the worst in people,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><strong>THE WORLD’S deadliest Covid outbreak is ravaging Peru, with 10 per cent of all patients dying as the Lambda variant runs riot.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Peru has been hit hard by the pandemic, with the nation experiencing more deaths per capita than any other country since the coronavirus broke out.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/the-lambda-covid-19-variant-what-do-we-know-about-it-1.5497757">CTV News</a> reported the country had 586 deaths per 100,000 people, as of July 5.</p>



<p>Hospitals have been overrun and demand for oxygen has skyrocketed, sending supplies plummeting.</p>



<p>Local residents told <a href="https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-coronavirus-pandemic-peru-d642e0762796cd490f0ce8d819d3eeea">AP</a> that hundreds of people who died of Covid-10 were buried in mass graves when official cemeteries began to run out of space.</p>



<p>One such gravesite, next to the San Juan cemetery, near Iquitos, was reportedly larger than four soccer fields.</p>



<p>People came to place crosses where they thought their loved ones were buried &#8211; but with a lack of definitive markings, it was hard to really know.</p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VP-GRAPH-COVID-PERU-05-JUL-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=800" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15508791" width="800" height="960" />



<p>Some 187,000 people have died across the country after suffering from the virus, since Covid-19 first broke out at the beginning of 2020.</p>



<p>The Lambda variant is currently classed as &#8220;under investigation&#8221; and experts could then classify it as &#8220;of concern&#8221; once they have done a risk assessment.</p>



<p>This will depend on how transmissible the variant is and how many cases have been detected.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/malaysia/">Malaysian </a>Health Authority claims the variant comes from Peru, a country with one of the highest <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">Covid </a>mortality rates in the world.</p>



<p>Also known as C.37, the Lambda strain was first detected in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/peru/">Peru</a> in 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15493742/lambda-variant-could-be-deadlier-than-delta/">Of particular concern to virologists is the L452Q spike protein</a> because of its potential to infect human cells like the L452R mutation in the highly infectious Delta variant.</p>



<p>As the Lambda variant spreads rapidly across the world, experts are saying it is more transmissible, and so could drive surges in new infections and hospitalisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it had been detected in at least 30 territories &#8211; including the United Kingdom &#8211; and was particularly prevalent in South America.</p>



<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/7/6/Lambda-variant-COVID-19-Peru.html">CNN Philippines</a>, Infectious Diseases Specialist Dr. Rontgene Solante said Lambda, also known as the&nbsp; C.37 variant, was more transmissible, meaning it could drive surges in new infections and hospitalisations.</p>

<p>While there was no specific data yet around whether it would lead to more deaths, Dr. Solante , who was a member of the government’s vaccine experts panel, said it was likely dangerous for elderly people, or those with comorbidities.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you talk about a variant that is highly transmissible, then that will be responsible for [a] surge of cases and hospitalizations,” he said.</p>



<p>“Most likely for those vulnerable, that can also be [a] higher risk of mortality”.</p>



<p>Another concern Solante outlined was the possibility that the Lambda variant may affect the efficacy rate and a person’s reaction to antibody treatments.</p>



<p>Experts at the University of Chile who studied the virus in local healthcare workers, who received two doses of China&#8217;s CoronaVac jab, say Lambda is more infectious than the Brazilian and UK mutations.</p>



<p>They wrote in a paper yet to be peer reviewed: &#8220;Our data show for the first time that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant confer escape to neutralising antibodies and increased infectivity,.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is possible that it may exhibit higher infection rates, but we don&#8217;t yet have enough reliable data to compare it to gamma or delta.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Solante stressed that Covid-19 vaccines remain effective against all variants of concern &#8211; and help to prevent severe illness and death.</p>



<p>Researchers in the United States from New York University Grossman School of Medicine, <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210705/Study-says-mRNA-COVID-vaccines-are-effective-against-Lambda-variant.aspx">conducting a study </a>into the effectiveness of vaccines against the lambda variant, had positive feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the lambda spike protein showed partial resistance to neutralization by vaccine-elicited antibodies and convalescent sera, the team said the average 3-fold decrease in neutralizing titer against the variant is not likely to result in any significant loss of protection against infection.</p>

<p>FOOTAGE shows a scorched cliff face where a Russian plane crashed while making its second approach to land during poor weather — killing all 28 people on board.</p>



<p>The An-26 plane had been flying from the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to the town of Palana on the Okhotsk Sea coast, missed a scheduled communication and disappeared from radar screens while on an approach for landing.</p>

<p>None of the 22 passengers and six crew are believed to have survived.</p>



<p>Kamchatka governor Vladimir Solodov said the 39-year-old Soviet-era plane crashed while making a second attempt to land because of &#8220;poor visibility&#8221;.</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s state aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, said parts of the plane were found about three miles from the airport&#8217;s runway, near the coast line.</p>



<p>Part of the fuselage was found on a mountain side and another part was floating in the Okhotsk Sea.</p>



<p>Sergei Gorb, deputy director of Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise, said the plane practically crashed into a sea cliff, which was not supposed to be in its landing trajectory.</p>

<p>Emergency officials first said they had located the An-26 crash site in the Sea of Okhotsk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plane was believed to have failed to clear a high cliff on the Sea of Okhotsk.</p>



<p>The Federal Air Transport Agency told reporters that the crash site was discovered between two and four miles from the runway at Palana.</p>



<p>The search is hampered by darkness and a tide which has washed away some of the wreckage, say reports.</p>



<p>Mash media cited ambulance sources as saying no survivors were expected.</p>

<p>The head of the Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise, Aleksey Khrabrov, said: &#8220;We have found the wreckage of the plane. Where and under what circumstances, I cannot say.&#8221;</p>



<p>The plane, which belonged to a company called Kamchatka Aviation Enterprise, missed a scheduled communication and disappeared from the radars, local emergency officials said.</p>



<p>The An-26 was coming in for a landing when contact was lost six miles away from Palana&#8217;s airport.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Valentina Glazova, a spokeswoman for the local transport prosecutor&#8217;s office, told AFP new agency: &#8220;All that is known at this time, what has been possible to establish, is that communication with the plane was interrupted and it did not land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Russian news agencies quoted local officials as saying there were 28 people on board, including six crew.</p>



<p>It is reported Alisa Khvaleyeva, 6, was on board, as was villager Artyom Tishchenko, 17.</p>



<p>Another passenger was mother-of-three Yulia Surovtseva, 43, who ran a puppet theatre in Palana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The head of the Palana village administration, Olga Mokhireva, 42, was  also reported to have been on board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pilot was named as Dmitry Nikiforov, and the co-pilot&nbsp;Alexander Anisimov, 27.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin ordered a special commission to find out what had happened to the plane.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A criminal case was also launched into its fate, a normal measure when a plane goes missing or crashes in Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia, once notorious for plane accidents, has improved its air traffic safety record in recent years.</p>



<p>But poor aircraft maintenance and lax safety standards still persist, and the country has seen several deadly air accidents in recent years.</p>



<p>A hotline has been set up for relatives who will be offered psychological assistance.</p>



<p>The An-26&nbsp;that vanished today is a twin-engined&nbsp;turboprop&nbsp;civilian and&nbsp;military transport aircraft, designed and produced in the&nbsp;Soviet Union&nbsp;from 1969 to 1986.</p>



<p>In August, a&nbsp;South West Aviation&nbsp;An-26&nbsp;turboprop aircraft crashed while taking off from&nbsp;Juba Airport&nbsp;in&nbsp;Juba, South Sudan.</p>

<p>A month later an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12772202/military-plane-crashes-flames-ukraine/">An-26 hit the ground</a> while coming into land near the town of Chuguyev in the east of Ukraine, killing 22 of the 28 people on board. </p>



<p>The last major air accident in Russia took place in May 2019, when a Sukhoi Superjet belonging to the flag carrier airline Aeroflot crash-landed and caught fire on the runway of a Moscow airport, killing 41 people.</p>



<p>In February 2018, a Saratov Airlines An-148 aircraft crashed near Moscow shortly after take-off, killing all 71 people on board. </p>



<p>An investigation later concluded that the accident was caused by human error.</p>

<p>Russia also frequently experiences non-fatal air incidents that result in re-routed flights and emergency landings, usually stemming from technical issues.</p>



<p>In August 2019, a Ural Airlines flight carrying more than 230 people made a miracle landing in a Moscow corn field after a flock of birds were sucked into the engines shortly after take-off.</p>



<p>In February 2020, a Utair Boeing 737 carrying 100 people crash-landed on its belly in northern Russia after its landing system malfunctioned. All of the flight&#8217;s passengers and its crew survived.</p>



<p>Flying in Russia can also be dangerous in the vast country&#8217;s isolated regions with difficult weather conditions such as the Arctic and the Far East.</p>

<p>THE lair used by infamous drug lord Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzman to escape cops is up for sale for just £9.</p>



<p>His former safe house, which comes complete with the secret hot tub tunnel, is to be raffled off in Mexico for the bargain price, along with other properties owned by big cartel names.</p>

<p>The Sinaloa cartel kingpin fled the home in Culiacan as police moved in to arrest him in 2014. </p>



<p>He dramatically escaped through a tunnel under the bathtub that connected to a storm drain, only to be arrested six days later. </p>



<p>After his subsequent reimprisonment, he upped his antics and performed a second escape in July 2015 from the Altiplano prison in Almoloya de Juarez by fleeing through a hole under the shower in his cell. </p>



<p>He has made numerous bold breakouts, including one in 2001 when he managed to escape Puente Grande, a maximum-security Mexican prison in the sate of Jalisco, by hiding in a laundry cart and bribing guards.</p>



<p>The 64-year-old is <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2660520/where-is-el-chapo-now/">now serving a life sentence in a US prison</a>, but he was once considered the &#8220;most powerful drug trafficker in the world&#8221; by the US Department of the Treasury.</p>



<p>The accommodation up for grabs, which appears relatively understated from the outside, is worth about $184,000 &#8211; equivalent to £133,000 &#8211; but is being sold for just 250 pesos, or £9. </p>



<p>Behind the white facade hides a high-security safe house with scores of cameras and reinforced steel doors. </p>

<p>The interior is modest &#8211; which was said to be part of El Chapo&#8217;s strategy to be able to hide in plain sight. </p>



<p>But beneath the bathroom&#8217;s tub lies a secret tunnel which leads users to a string of safe houses via the town&#8217;s sewage system.</p>



<p>Culiacan, where the houses are located, is considered the 21st most dangerous city in the world, according to 2020 data. </p>



<p>El Chapo&#8217;s former home is among several assets being raffled off on September 15, the government confirmed. </p>



<p>The national lottery office said the &#8220;payback&#8221; consists of 248 different prizes, as well as cash worth $12.5 million. </p>



<p>Also up for grabs are 22 other homes, including the Mexico City mansion of the former head of the Juarez cartel, Amado Carrillo.</p>



<p>The luxury property boasts spas, saunas and a ballroom, as well as a large indoor pool, and is estimated to be worth about $3.8m.</p>



<p>A private box at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City will also be given away, with all proceeds going towards Covid-19 vaccines, scholarships and wellness programs. </p>

<p>El Chapo&nbsp;&#8211; which means &#8220;shorty&#8221; in English &#8211; was a moniker attributed in reference to his height.</p>



<p>He headed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12243444/who-leader-sinaloa-cartel-mayo-zambada/">Sinaloa Cartel</a> and was considered &#8220;one of the most powerful people in the world&#8221; by Forbes between 2009 and 2013.</p>



<p>He earned the nickname &#8220;El Rapido&#8221; for his speed at transporting drugs from Mexico to America for the Colombian cartels.</p>



<p>The Sinaloa cartel transported narcotics into the US by fishing boats, submarines, carbon fibre airplanes, trains with secret compartments and even transnational underground tunnels.</p>



<p>After the narcotics arrived in America, they were sold to wholesale distributors across the country.</p>



<p>El Chapo used elaborate schemes to launder the billions of dollars of drug proceeds, including bulk cash smuggling from the US to Mexico and infiltrating US-based insurance companies, reloadable debit cards, and numerous shell corporations, including a juice company and a fish flour business.</p>

<p><strong>IT is said to feel like two sharp nails being hammered into your skin – and we can reveal that deadly snake bites are rising dramatically in a trend that is worrying experts. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>An Austrian man was the latest victim when he &#8220;felt a pinch in the genital area&#8221; while sitting on his toilet at home in Graz on Monday, according to a local police report. </p>



<figure id="attachment_15506771" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000663935909.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15506771" width="720" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>Reptile expert Werner Stangl holding the python that slipped down the drains and bit a person while sitting on the toilet, in Graz, Austria[/caption]



<p>The 65-year-old victim looked into the bowl and found a 1.6m albino reticulated python looking back at him.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s thought the snake belonged to his 24-year-old neighbour and may have slithered into the victim&#8217;s toilet through the plumbing, but exactly how it got there remains unclear. </p>



<p>The victim was treated in hospital for minor injuries – others aren&#8217;t so lucky.</p>



<p>Student Siraphop Masukarat was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/12622186/teen-rushed-hospital-python-bit-penis-blood/">bitten by a 4ft python while sitting on his </a>toilet last September.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12642276" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607114375-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12642276" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Viral Press</figcredit></figure>Siraphop Masukarat&#8217;s blood spattered toilet in Thailand &#8211; where a python sunk its fangs into his penis last week[/caption]



<p>The 18-year-old was watching videos on his phone like so many teenagers do when he felt something clamping downstairs – and realised a snake had sunk its fangs into the tip of his penis.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the quick-thinking lad was able to leap up and, with his trousers around his ankles, slam the bathroom door against the slithering serpent until it finally let go.</p>



<p>&#8220;I looked down and saw there was a snake hanging in the toilet,” he told local media in the city of Nonthaburi, Thailand, around 20km north of Bangkok,</p>



<p>&#8220;Then there was blood everywhere. It was only a small snake but its bite was so strong. I hope my penis can recover.”</p>



<figure id="attachment_12642284" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607106118-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12642284" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>ViralPress</figcredit></figure>The 18-year-old is just the latest victim of a dangerous snake, with bite numbers rocketing around the world in recent years[/caption]



<p>The latest research shows that around 5.4m snake bites were inflicted on humans globally last year – while 10 years ago the figure was sometimes as low as 1.2m a year.</p>



<p>The World Health Organisation is now calling the attacks &#8220;arguably the world&#8217;s biggest hidden health crisis&#8221;, with one person dying from a bite every four minutes.</p>



<h2>Bite numbers slithering up</h2>



<p>Somewhere between 81,000 and 138,000 people die annually from snake strikes after falling prey.</p>



<p>And around 400,000 more are left seriously disfigured as the venomous bites can result in the need for amputation and cause paralysis, kidney or liver failure and fatal bleeding.</p>

<p>In some parts of Africa, less than two per cent of people have access to the right antivenom needed to survive.</p>



<p>While most attacks occur in poor, rural communities in less economically developed countries, the reptiles are increasingly popping up in the most unexpected of places in more modern cities – door frames, gardens and toilet bowls, as poor Siraphop found out.</p>



<p>In 2019, four-year-old <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10600264/hero-dad-saves-screaming-son-4-15ft-pythons-jaws-punching-battering-sledgehammer/">Clifford Thompson almost lost his life</a> when he was attacked by a 15ft scrub python that tried to drag him away from his father. </p>

<p>His dad Evan had just moved into his new house at Airlie Beach in north Queensland, Australia, and was hosting a housewarming party in the garden when the beast struck.</p>



<p>Evan repeatedly punched the snake until it let go and thankfully doctors were able to save his son’s life.</p>



<h2>UK in Adders&#8217; grip</h2>



<p>Snake attacks are less common in England but it is wrong to assume they never happen.</p>



<p>In July last year, three-year-old Lewis Wise was enjoying a family picnic at Lightwater Country Park in Surrey when <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12126055/three-year-old-boy-hospital-bitten-poisonous-snake/">he was bitten by an adder.</a></p>



<figure id="attachment_12642583" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7535950b-c88d-4339-a39f-b1071ee1e1f4-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12642583" width="960" height="777" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>BPM Media</figcredit></figure>Lewis Wise, three, was left in &#8216;excruciating pain&#8217; when he was bitten by an adder in Surrey[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_12642597" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 730px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000595728465.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=720" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12642597" width="720" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>BPM Media</figcredit></figure>The swelling on Lewis&#8217; leg was so bad that he was left unable to walk[/caption]



<p>Dad Daniel, 39, said at the time: “He has been really brave but the swelling is so big, he can’t move at the moment.”</p>



<p>“We think he may have trod on it by accident and it latched onto his leg. It was instant and then he was in excruciating pain.</p>



<p>Adders are grey in colour and have distinctive dark zig zag markings down their back and their bites – while not normally deadly – are extremely painful.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12642887" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000316151681.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12642887" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty - Contributor</figcredit></figure>Adders are native to the UK &#8211; it has a painful bite, but it&#8217;s not usually fatal[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_12642899" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607301647.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12642899" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Mercury Press</figcredit></figure>Adders mostly attack when provoked which is why lots of dogs get bitten &#8211; like Chloe, the Yorkshire Terrier, who was bitten in Dorset[/caption]



<p>Speaking after an adder attack in Grimsby in 2019, a Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust spokesperson said the snakes are shy typically and on the decline in the UK but added: “Those that are most vulnerable are young children, the elderly and dogs.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you see an adder, don&#8217;t approach it. Leave it be.”</p>



<h2>Flesh-eating venom</h2>



<p>It is the poisonous snakes you might bump into while on holiday overseas that cause the most concern, however.</p>



<p>Climate changes and extreme weather like heat waves, droughts and floods are forcing them to migrate – slithering to new territories – and experts say there is an urgent need to create new snake maps that show where they are calling home.</p>



<p>If the correct antivenom is not immediately available the results can be catastrophic.</p>



<p>One unnamed 13-year-old girl in Caracas, Venezuela, for instance, was not treated in time after being bitten by a Bothrops viper and so much tissue died as a result that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/458664/black-and-rotten-a-girl-may-lose-her-leg-after-snake-attack/">her leg developed necrosis</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12642555" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 488px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9a3240e1-62de-4319-a8be-c233a782e762.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=478" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12642555" width="478" height="645" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Instagram</figcredit></figure>This is the shocking necrosis which ate the flesh of a teen&#8217;s leg in Venezuela after she was bitten by a Bothrops viper[/caption]



<p>Doctors had no choice but to amputate before the poison spread further and killed her.</p>



<p>Vets in the US have even <a href="https://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/what-actually-happens-after-snakebite/3212672/">shared horrific pictures</a> to show what a bite from a Sharp-nosed viper does to the human body.</p>



<p>Australian-based venomologist Dr Bryan Fry said after seeing the photos: &#8220;That type of snake has a venom that is extremely tissue destroying.</p>



<p>&#8220;The reason for this is that they kill their prey by haemorrhagic shock, where some parts of the venom damage the blood vessel walls, while other parts destroy the ability of the blood to clot, leading to a state of massive internal bleeding in a prey animal.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Surprise face bite caught on camera</h2>



<p>American Jerel Heywood was one of the lucky ones who survived a snake strike.</p>



<p>He was rushed to hospital in 2019 after a 5ft long snake darted out from above his friend’s front door and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9030446/freaky-moment-man-bitten-face-by-snake-bullsnake-oklahoma-usa/">bit him on the face</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12642981" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 585px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607587210.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=575" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12642981" width="575" height="426" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Jerel Heywood was bitten on the face hiding on a porch light in Oklahoma</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>

<p>Locals in Lawton, Oklahoma, believe the serpent had wrapped itself around a porch light to take shelter from an earlier rainstorm.</p>



<p>Remarkably, the incident was caught on his pal’s doorbell camera and has gone viral on the internet. And while Jerel survived the snake was pummelled to death by a neighbour armed with a hammer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was in shock,&#8221; his friend Rodney Copeland <a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/doorbell-camera-captures-the-terrifying-moment-a-snake-attacks-an-oklahoma-man" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">said afterwards</a>. “That could have been any of us.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Stag party tongue bite horror</h2>



<p>Also spare a thought for the drunk German stag party guest who thought he had spied a harmless worm while out partying in the Austrian Alps last year.</p>



<p>The man, who has not been named, was suddenly bitten on the tongue by the poisonous reptile.</p>



<p>The 38-year-old was treated by mountain rescuers at the scene but then had to be rushed 40 miles to a remote provincial hospital in Wiener Neustadt, Austria, as his tongue continued to swell.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12643012" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/936ee7ca-50fa-463d-9a15-4ac165ffb8b7.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12643012" width="960" height="661" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty - Contributor</figcredit></figure>Adders are found all over Europe, as well as in the UK[/caption]



<p>His ordeal was nothing, however, compared with a 46-year-old Indian man who was struck by a Levantine viper while answering a call of nature in 2015.</p>



<p>Three hours later his penis was swelling horrifically as two blood-filled blisters ballooned around the puncture marks.</p>



<p>The snake’s venom also interfered with his blood’s ability to clot and he was close to death when doctors treated him in a hospital emergency room in Sringar in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12643026" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607591991.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12643026" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy</figcredit></figure>The fearsome Levantine viper&#8217;s bite left the man&#8217;s penis horrifically covered in blisters[/caption]



<p>It took a few days for the penile swelling to subside and he was left with scabs of black, dead tissue where the blood-filled blisters had been.</p>



<h2>Deadly bite from decapitated head</h2>



<p>Another terrifying attack took place in Texas in 2018.</p>



<p>Jennifer Sutcliffe and her husband Milo were gardening outside their home near Corpus Christi when they spotted a four-foot rattlesnake slithering towards them.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12643108" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000411594824.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12643108" width="960" height="957" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Milo Sutcliffe/Facebook</figcredit></figure>Milo Sutcliffe with wife Jennifer, who was with him during his terrifying rattlesnake attack[/caption]



<p>Showing no fear, her husband grabbed a shovel and beheaded the snake.</p>



<p>But when he then bent down to dispose of the reptile, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6470006/snake-severed-head-attack-texas-man-nearly-dies/">its severed head leapt up and sunk its teeth into his skin</a>, discharging a full load of venom.</p>



<p>This was because snakes can still retaliate for a few seconds after they have been killed.</p>



<p>The man began having seizures, lost his vision, suffered internal bleeding and had to be airlifted to the hospital.</p>



<p>Once there, doctors administered massive amounts of the antivenom CroFab as they battled to keep him alive. A week later he was stable but with weakened kidney function.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12643121" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 617px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607589403.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=607" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12643121" width="607" height="332" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Kiiitv.com</figcredit></figure>Milo decapitated the deadly snake with a shovel, but it was still able to bite him[/caption]



<h2>Livestream snake suicide</h2>



<p>Russian snake expert Arslan Valeev decided to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4620294/arslan-valeev-video-snake-expert-black-mamba-bite/">live stream being bitten by a Black Mamba</a> after breaking up with his wife Ekaterina ‘Katya’ Pyatyzhkina in 2017.</p>



<p>“Pass on to Katya that I loved her very much,” he told his audience while moving his hand towards the camera.</p>



<figure id="attachment_12643145" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 946px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/db1a6a32-3553-4869-a6a3-11736743bf50.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=936" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12643145" width="936" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Arslan Valeev was heartbroken when his wife Katya left him</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>

<p>BONKERS footage has emerged showing Russian army pooches parachuting into battle zones from heights of 13,000ft.</p>



<p>Vladimir Putin’s crack team of canine warriors can be seen being hurled out of planes strapped to soldiers as part of wacky war games.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15505440" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664071996.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15505440" width="960" height="673" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>Paw games&#8230; the dog looks down as it plunges towards the mock battle zone[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15505446" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664071995.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15505446" width="960" height="639" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>East2West</figcredit></figure>This jump was one of eight involving the para pooches[/caption]



<p>Tests have so far proved army dogs can be dropped by parachute from as high as 13,000 feet, according to the Russian defence ministry’s TV channel Zvezda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report says: &#8220;After landing, all four-legged test participants felt well and were ready to follow commands.&#8221;</p>



<p>The canine &#8220;security forces&#8221; are often used in military and rescue operations, according to the army.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Test parachutist Andrey Toporkov said the dogs have already made eight jumps.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;The most important thing is to get the dogs into the aircraft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;They tolerate the flight and even watch the clouds through the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;When the hatch opens, there is wind, noise, and thanks to the dog handler, they calm down.&#8221;</p>

					<span class="quote-credit"> Andrey Toporkov, test parachutist</span>				</cite>
					</div>
	</blockquote>
	<!--googleon: all-->




<p>Mr Toporkov continued: &#8220;So there were no problems when a dog handler participated in the jump, you had to get acquainted with the dog in advance, pet it, feed it with the owner&#8217;s permission, so that the dog would trust you later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;And you can&#8217;t be afraid of yourself — dogs feel everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>A special tandem harness made by the Ivanovo parachute factory allows a military specialist to jump with both a handler and a dog.</p>



<p>President Putin last year visited the plant and inspected the new harnesses which are intended for the rapid deployment of military dogs in places where it is impossible to land planes or helicopters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Design chief Alexey Kozin said research is underway to allow for dogs to be groups from 26,000 ft but this would require an oxygen supply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Zvezda report said: &#8220;During the first tests, an amazing fact was revealed — even from a height of several kilometres, the dog observes the earth and tries to catch it with its paws.</p>



<p>&#8220;Previously, it was believed that dogs cannot see so far.&#8221;</p>



<p>The dog harnesses protect the animals’ backs, said Kozin.</p>



<p>They can be adapted to dogs weighing up to 45 kilograms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The system can be used for landing almost any dog serving in the law enforcement agencies,&#8221; Mr Kozin said.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15504979" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 521px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664069844.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=511" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15504979" width="511" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Tiktok/@zoenesquik</figcredit></figure>The horrified 19-year-old shared a video of her discovery on TikTok[/caption]



<p>She shared the video of her pulling down her sock with her 42,000 <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/">TikTok</a> followers.</p>



<p>In the clip, an anxious Zoe shouts: &#8220;Look at my ankle, there&#8217;s a huge lump there&#8221; before letting out a long and loud &#8220;Nooo&#8221;. </p>



<p>She then yells: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to lift up my sock&#8221; before peeling it back and revealing a huge leech. </p>



<p>A scream that makes the hairs on your arms stand up then follows, as Zoe asks: &#8220;What do I do?&#8221;</p>



<p>A man pulls her sock off and the &#8220;f**king huge&#8221; leech falls out onto a rug.</p>



<p>The footage has racked up more than 15 million views, with users of the popular video sharing app even cutting it with their own reaction. </p>



<p>And tens of thousands of comments share her horror, with one saying they would have to &#8220;cut off my foot&#8221; if the same thing had happened to them. </p>



<h2>&#8216;FREAKED ME OUT&#8217;</h2>



<p>Zoe, from Geelong in Victoria, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Australia</a>, had been out walking at Stevenson Falls then returned home and noticed something wasn&#8217;t right. </p>



<p>She said her &#8220;heart instantly dropped&#8221; when she noticed the lump under the sock.</p>



<p>She was &#8220;happy to handle huntsmans and other spiders&#8221; but finding the leech was something else.</p>



<p>&#8220;This one caught me off guard and freaked me out,&#8221; she told <a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/aussie-teen-shares-terrifying-moment-she-found-leech-in-sock/news-story/ecfac87758fbf066687d1dcb3b73ff10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news.com.au</a>.</p>



<p>But thankfully the bite wasn&#8217;t too sore, instead feeling &#8220;really itchy&#8221; afterwards. </p>



<p>She said: &#8220;It wasn’t painful at all. </p>



<p>&#8220;I did have an allergic reaction though so my leg was swollen and there was a solid lump about the size of a 50 cent coin under the wound for a few days, it was really itchy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leeches can be found in rivers, dams, creeks or lagoons.</p>



<p>Experts advise people not to pull a leech off the skin directly, instead applying heat or salt to ease it away. </p>



<p>The skin should then be treated like any other bleeding wound, followed by a clean, tight bandage to apply pressure, according to St John Ambulance Victoria.</p>



<p>But medical attention should be sought if the area becomes infected or if an ulcer appears.</p>

<p>A BABY was left blinded and with horrific burns to her head and neck in a freak accident with a hairdryer.</p>



<p>Sienna Robbins had been sleeping on her parents&#8217; double bed when she rolled onto the floor and managed to turn on the dryer that was lying nearby.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15504777" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 642px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000664056043.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=632" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15504777" width="632" height="650" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>SUPPLIED/ NEWS.AU</figcredit></figure>The seven-month-old rolled off her parents bed and accidentally turned on a hairdryer causing the burn[/caption]



<p>The hot blast from the hairdryer left the baby with second and third-degree burns on her head and neck that required urgent surgery.</p>



<p>Her eyes were also swollen shut, leaving her blind for three days.</p>



<p>Sienna is currently in Adelaide’s Women’s and Children’s Hospital.</p>



<p>Here she was expected to need surgery every two days over the next six weeks while her traumatised parents camp by her bedside.</p>



<p>Mum Dannielle Robbins said she and husband Levi had been playing board games in the lounge room with their family when the accident happened on Saturday night.</p>



<p>Speaking on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-sienna-robbins-recover">GoFundMe page</a> she set up to help with costs, Dannielle said: &#8220;Sienna’s room is right near the lounge so I put her in our room so we didn’t wake her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I checked on her every 15 mins and I put barricades on either side of the bed so she wouldn’t crawl off (our bed is low to the ground).&#8221;</p>



<p>But when Dannielle heard the hairdryer going, she said she &#8220;raced&#8221; to check on Sienna, and found her rolled on her back on the floor with terrible burns to her head and neck. </p>



<p>She said: &#8220;With the hairdryer on her she has suffered second and third degree burns on her head and down her neck.</p>



<p>&#8220;I yelled for Levi to call an ambulance, stripped us both down and jumped into the cold shower and put her on the breast while I poured cold water all over her head over and over again.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was taken to hospital with huge blisters forming on her head, the infant’s eyes swollen shut, rendering her blind.</p>

<p>Following one operation, Sienna’s parents were told she’d need many more and that her hair &#8220;most likely will not grow back in some heavily burnt areas on her head&#8221;.</p>



<p>Dannielle said: &#8220;We, as her parents, are shattered that anything like this could happen to our little angel.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have spent the last four days sleep-deprived, not eating or drinking well and emotionally drained from the pain we see our baby in constantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have cried for days on end for our little girl and wish we could take her pain as our own.&#8221;</p>



<p>On Facebook, Dannielle – a nurse – described feeling &#8220;like the most horrible parents in the world&#8221;, following the shock accident.</p>

<p>AFGHAN looters ransacked a US military base swiping laptops, speakers and guitars after American troops fled in the dead of night.</p>



<p>Hundreds of soldiers have attempted to escape Taliban forces as the terror group sweeps the country and leaves it on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>It means Afghanistan&#8217;s Bagram Air Base, which housed up to 100,000 people at one stage, now sits empty after almost 20 years.</p>



<p>Troops slipped away without notifying the new Afghan commander, who only found out about their departure hours later.</p>



<p>Military officials shared photos of the sprawling base, providing a rare first glimpse of what was the epicentre of America&#8217;s war to unseat the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks.</p>



<p>But before the local army could take control, the airfield&#8217;s barracks were invaded by looters.</p>



<p>They made off with computers, stereos and basketballs before being evicted, according to Afghan military officials. </p>



<p>A senior Afghan government official said: &#8220;They (Americans) are completely out now and everything is under our control, including watchtowers, air traffic and the hospital.&#8221;</p>



<p>Photos from the base, which is part of a campaign that has cost the US military $816 billion and 2,312 lives, according to the Department of Defense, show dozens of vehicles left behind. </p>

<p>Bagram&#8217;s new commander Gen. Mir Asadullah Kohistani said the US left behind 3.5 million items at the massive facility, the size of a small city. </p>



<p>“When you say 3.5 million items, it is every small items, like every phone, every door knob, every window in every barracks, every door in every barracks,” he said.</p>



<p>Small weapons and ammunition were also left behind, but departing troops took the big ticket items with them. </p>



<p>Afghan soldier Naematullah said: &#8220;In one night they lost all the good will of 20 years by leaving the way they did, in the night, without telling the Afghan soldiers who were outside patrolling the area.&#8221;</p>



<p>Within 20 minutes of the group&#8217;s departure on Friday, the base was plunged into darkness as the electricity was shut down. </p>



<p>US and NATO forces have now almost completely pulled out of Afghanistan.</p>



<p>The final American soldiers are likely to remain until an agreement to protect Kabul Hamid Karzai International Airport is completed.</p>



<p>It is anticipated this will be done by Turkey.</p>

<p>A resurgent Taliban has seized control of a third of Afghanistan, opening the door for the rise of terrorist groups such as ISIS.</p>



<p>The country&#8217;s soldiers have <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15489598/taliban-surges-hundreds-soldiers-flee-afghanistan/">fled across the border into Tajikistan</a> rather than fight the insurgents. </p>



<p>Tajik President Emomali Rahmon mobilised 20,000 military reservists to help bolster the border with Afghanistan on Monday. </p>



<p>He also made a series of international calls to discuss the situation with allies, including Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>The Kremlin said Putin assured Rakhmon that Moscow has his back and would support the former Soviet republic if required. </p>



<img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ac-map-talibans-afghan-territory-v2-1.jpg?strip=all" alt="" class="alignnone" />



<p>It comes as security experts warn that Afghanistan risks becoming hell on Earth, with the dire fate that awaits Afghan people.</p>



<p>They say the state <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15439984/afghanistan-isis-taliban-terror-battleground/">risks descending into a &#8220;terror battleground&#8221;</a> as the US withdraws its last troops after two decades.</p>



<p>US General Scott Miller has warned the country is on the verge of &#8220;civil war&#8221; as Taliban militants have seized more than one third of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;That should be a concern to the world,&#8221; said General Miller.</p>



<p>And it is feared the nation could become a new haven for terrorist forces wanting to strike out against the West, with The Sun Online revealing concerns new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15420504/taliban-training-camps-afghanistan-west/">training camps could be operational by September</a>.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">


			<div>
<p>US forces have begun a full withdrawal from Afghanistan under the orders of US President Joe Biden after spending 20 years fighting to stablise the war-torn nation.</p>
<p>Some 456 British soldiers and 2,420 Americans &#8211; along with hundreds of other coalition troops &#8211; died during the war which was sparked by the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And the civilian casualties are estimated to have been almost 50,000.</p>
<p>Codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom, the US led an invasion off Afghanistan to oust the Taliban after al-Qaeda flew planes into the World Trade Centre and other US buildings in 2001.</p>
<p>The mission was to oust the Taliban, who were said to be harbouring terrorists and providing them a safe haven &#8211; including Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>What followed was nearly 20 years of grinding conflict as the US, its allies, and the Afghan security forces staged a grinding campaign to attempt to rebuild the country and beat back the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Taliban had ruled most of Afghanistan following the Afghan Civil War in the 90s &#8211; sparked by the withdrawal of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Western nations had actually supported the Taliban in the 80s as the ran an insurgency against the Soviet backed regime of Mohammad Najibullah.</p>
<p>However, after seizing power in 1996 &#8211; the Taliban brutally ruled Afghanistan and offered a safe haven to terrorist killers like Osama.</p>
<p>As the US war rolled on into the 2010s, Bin Laden was killed in May, 2011, in a US special forces raid in Abbotabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p>And since then there has been a slow withdrawal, with British troops officially ending combat operations in October 2014.</p>
<p>February 2020 saw a peace deal signed between the US and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, which agreed to a withdrawal &#8211; whoever the Afghan government criticised it as being done behind &#8220;closed doors&#8221;.</p>
<p>Taliban forces have since continued their operations and have been gaining ground &#8211; and the US continues to pull back its troops.</p>
<p>The war is seen as defeating the Taliban and improving the lives of the Afghan people who were once living under strict Islamic law and who now have free elections.</p>
<p>However, for some it is unfinished job which was mishandled &#8211; and that may 20 years on simply see a return to the dominance of the Taliban as they did pre-9/11.</p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>Professor Anthony Glees, from the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said the Taliban are now &#8220;back with a vengeance&#8221;.</p>



<p>The group&#8217;s leaders will <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15495944/taliban-calls-nato-and-us-troops-invaders/">treat NATO and US forces as &#8220;invaders&#8221;</a> if they fail to leave Afghanistan by September, a spokesperson has said.</p>



<p>But the most immediate impacts may be on the people of Afghanistan.</p>



<p>They face being plunged back beneath the rule of a brutal regime who enforce strict versions of Islamic law and issue punishments such as beheading and torture.</p>

<p>TWO young women froze to death while on a mountain tour of the Alps “after wearing the wrong clothing”.</p>



<p>Martina Sviluppo, 29, and Paola Viscardi, 28, died at the weekend during a climb on the Vincent Pyramid mountain, part of the Monte Rosa Massif, a group of mountains in the eastern part of the Pennine Alps.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15500094" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663838214-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15500094" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>Paola Viscardi (right) and Martina Sviluppo (left) froze to death in Monte Rosa[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15500154" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663838151.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15500154" width="768" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>The best friends were both from the Piedmont region in Italy[/caption]



<p>It lies between the Italian region Piedmont and Aosta Valley and the Swiss region Valais.</p>



<p>The best friends from Piedmont, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/italy/">Italy</a>, along with a male friend, Valerio Zolla, 27, decided to spend their Saturday taking on an easy high-altitude mountaineering climb to the mountain&#8217;s summit, despite weather forecast warnings.</p>



<p>According to reports, the climbers made it to the top of the mountain safely.</p>



<p>During the descent, they lost their way and started wandering around trying to find the correct path.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15500157" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 923px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663838185.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=913" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15500157" width="913" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>Paola Viscardi, pictured, lost her way, along with her friends while descending the mountain[/caption]



<p>Due to the fact that they were still located at a high altitude with mist from low lying clouds, their visibility was very poor.</p>



<p>During their search for the right path, a storm and strong winds broke out.</p>



<p>The climbers made their first call for help to the rescue centre in Aosta, but they were not able to indicate their exact position at 2pm.</p>



<p>All of the other telephone calls were interrupted, because of the storm.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15500184" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 778px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663838084.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=768" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15500184" width="768" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Newsflash</figcredit></figure>Martina Sviluppo, pictured, died along with her best pal[/caption]



<p>A rescue helicopter was dispatched but was initially unable to land due to the bad weather.</p>



<p>A group then set out on foot from a lower hut on the mountain but they were unable to reach the women in time.</p>



<p>One of the women is said to have died shortly after help arrived with the other one taken to a hut where a doctor was unable to revive her, according to a report in the Italian newspaper <a href="https://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2021/07/04/news/incidenti_montagna_due_alpiniste_morte_assiderate_sul_monte_rosa-308823386/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Repubblica</a>.</p>



<p>Zolla survived the ordeal but suffered hypothermia and frostbite and was taken to a Swiss hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>According to the rescuers, the group was said to be well equipped for a mountain tour in normal weather conditions.</p>



<p>But added their clothes were not designed for long periods outdoors at night.</p>



<p>Meteorologist Valentina Acordon said that while the temperature on the mountain was -4C it would have felt like -15C due to the strong winds, according to the Italian news report.</p>

<p>TWO teenage sisters have been killed, and a third sibling is injured, after they were hit by a bolt of lightning while hiking.</p>



<p>The girls, identified as Benedicte Myrset, 18, and 12-year-old Victoria Myrset from Oslo, were struck in the southern Norway mountains on Sunday.</p>

<p>They were on the Melshorn mountain, a popular destination, when the accident happened.</p>



<p>Officials in Hareid said a third person, also a sister in the same family but who was not named, was injured and taken to a nearby hospital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She was then transferred to a larger hospital in Bergen, Norway&#8217;s second largest city.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bergen is 308 kilometers (191 miles) northwest of Oslo.</p>



<p>In a statement, Hareid Mayor Bernt Brandal called it a deeply tragic event that no one could have predicted because the weather changed tremendously fast.</p>



<p>Norwegian broadcaster NRK said more than 800 lightning strikes were recorded in the area Sunday afternoon and early evening.</p>

<p>EXPERTS have called for a four-day working week to be tried in the UK after the biggest-ever trial in Iceland was hailed an “overwhelming success”.</p>



<p>Workers were found to be less stressed and had a better work-life balance while employers saw no drastic fall in productivity or provision of services, analysis found.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15499695" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000585277357.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15499695" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy</figcredit></figure>The pilot scheme in Iceland found workers were less stressed and anxious (file photo)[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15499707" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000404086931.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15499707" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy Live News</figcredit></figure>The reduced working hours gave people more time to pursue other interests[/caption]



<p>The trial, which ran from 2015 to 2019, resulted in around 86 per cent of Icelandic workers negotiating contracts with permanently shortened hours.</p>



<p>Director of research at British think tank Autonomy Will Stronge said: “This study shows that the world’s largest ever trial of a shorter working week in the public sector was by all measures an overwhelming success.</p>



<p>“It shows that the public sector is ripe for being a pioneer of shorter working weeks – and lessons can be learned for other governments.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/iceland/">Iceland</a> has taken a big step towards the four-day working week, providing a great real-life example for local councils and those in the UK public sector considering implementing it here in the UK.”</p>



<p>The experiment in Iceland initially included just a few dozen public sector workers who were members of unions.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15499734" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000642629819.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15499734" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>The pilot scheme found workers had no dramatic drop in productivity (file photo)[/caption]



<p>But it expanded to include 2,500 workers from both the public and private sector – representing one per cent of the country’s workforce &#8211; as the trial progressed.</p>



<p>Cops, healthcare workers, teachers, shop assistants and council workers were among those taking part in the trials, according to a report published by Autonomy and Iceland&#8217;s Association for Sustainable Democracy.</p>



<p>Although the experiment was dubbed a “four-day week” in reality most workers did not actually take a full day off work but aimed to reduce their hours from 40 to 35 or 36 each week.</p>



<p>The time saved at work was largely achieved by scrapping unnecessary meetings, taking shorter breaks and moving services online to allow offices to shut earlier.</p>



<p>Workers said because of the time saved they were able to organise their private lives better, such as running errands in the afternoons or doing more household chores.</p>



<p>They also said they had more time to see family and friends and had more time to relax or pursue hobbies.</p>



<p>Workers said they felt less stressed and anxious, both at home and at work.</p>



<p>Bosses said that because they had to think carefully about how office hours were managed, meant there was no significant drop-off in productivity to the ability to provide services.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15499754" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000644630227.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15499754" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>While workers did fewer hours in some cases productivity actually improved (file photo)[/caption]



<p>In fact, in a number of cases productivity actually improved.</p>



<p>The amount of overtime people did also remained flat, indicating workers had not just moved in-office tasks to their own free time.</p>



<p>Costs to bosses didn’t rise either, except in the area of healthcare, where it was necessary to employ more staff to cover the shift patterns.</p>



<p>Gudmundur D Haraldsson, a researcher at the Association for Sustainability and Democracy (Alda), said: “The Icelandic shorter working week journey tells us that not only is it possible to work less in modern times, but that progressive change is possible too.</p>



<p>“Our roadmap to a shorter working week in the public sector should be of interest to anyone who wishes to see working hours reduced.&#8221;</p>



<p>A poll published in July last year conducted by Survation found that 63 per cent of the UK public support the idea of a four-day week with no loss of pay, while only 12 per cent oppose.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/spain/">Spain</a> launched a pilot scheme in March which aimed to cut the working week to 32 hours, to see if it was possible to boost the country’s economy as it lifted coronavirus restrictions and aimed to boost employment.</p>



<p>Employees of companies taking part in the scheme would try to reduce their hours but maintain the same level of pay.</p>

<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has voiced support for a four-day working week and the Scottish and Welsh governments have also set up commissions to explore the idea.</p>



<p>Some economists though remain sceptical of introducing a four-day working week, arguing the standard of living would be decreased.</p>



<p>Ricardo Mur of CEOE, one of Spain’s main business associations, said at a forum in December: “Getting out of this crisis requires more work, not less.”</p>

<p><strong>A YOUNG woman was allegedly run over and killed by a drunken pal, as she desperately tried to prevent him from getting behind the wheel after drinking.</strong></p>



<p>Fernanda Olivares, known as &#8220;Polly&#8221;, passed away over the weekend after she was allegedly run over by Diego Armando Helguera after a birthday party in the city of Iztacalco, Mexico City, on June 12.</p>

<p>Polly, aged 26, was invited to Fernanda Cuadra&#8217;s birthday party, which Diego also attended, drinking heavily throughout.</p>



<p>When Diego wanted to leave the party he was stopped by Fernanda Cuadra, who noticed that he was heavily under the influence.</p>



<p>She took his car keys away from him, and while Diego was initially persistent, he eventually gave up and went to take a nap.</p>



<p>Once he was awake he again asked for the keys from birthday girl Fernanda, who, faced with his violent and rude behaviour, decided to give them to him.</p>



<p>Several of his colleagues became worried upon noticing he was heavily intoxicated and tried to prevent him from leaving the venue.</p>



<p>However, Diego ignored all of them and proceeded to his vehicle, while yelling insults to those around him.</p>



<p>Several people, including Polly and the birthday girl, continued following him outside of the building, hoping that they would stop him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Diego, however, got in the car regardless, and after starting it, he allegedly drove directly into the group of people, running over Polly and Fernanda Cuadra.</p>



<p>Leaving the two women on the street, Diego then fled the scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two women were transported to the Xoco General Hospital where Polly&#8217;s condition was diagnosed as critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She died a few days later.</p>

<p>Hamas began firing rockets into Israel after protests by Palestinians in May, prompting an 11 day conflict in which 256 people were killed in Gaza and 13 in<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/israel/"> Israel.</a></p>



<p>During the violence the Israeli military says that more than 4,300 rockets were fired from Gaza towards towns and cities.</p>



<p>Israel retaliated with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14969305/israeli-air-strike-high-rise-building-gaza/">air strikes and artillery </a>but didn’t deploy ground forces in its battle with the terrorists.</p>



<p>It now emerged Israeli forces used drone swarms in to target Hamas, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2282656-israel-used-worlds-first-ai-guided-combat-drone-swarm-in-gaza-attacks/">New Scientist reports.</a></p>



<p>Arthur Holland of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research said that “if confirmed, they are certainly a notch up in the incremental growth of autonomy and machine-to-machine collaboration in warfare&#8221;.</p>



<p>Drones have previously been directed by a single operator who ‘fly’ the aircraft from a remote base.</p>



<p>But in recent years, militaries have been working on developing Artificial Intelligence that allows the drones to work together without the need for an operator.</p>

<p>The basic idea of a drone swarm is that its machines are able to make decisions among themselves.</p>



<p>The swarm continue its mission, even if loses some drones during its mission.</p>



<p>The machine learning system is fed with data sourced from satellites, other reconnaissance drones, and aerial vehicles, as well as intelligence collected by ground units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unit 8200 of the Israel Defence Forces Intelligence Corps has developed algorithms using geographical, signal, and human intelligence data to identify these strategic strike points.</p>



<p>The IDF have been using AI and supercomputers to identify locations of Hamas activity and plan strikes to remove any strategic advantage.</p>



<p>The IDF has not confirmed any specifics of the autonomous swarm attack on Hamas targets.</p>



<p>As well as Israel, several countries including the<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8407220/raf-drone-swarms-gavin-williamson/"> UK</a>,<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10297077/russia-kamikaze-swarms-bomber-drones/"> Russia</a>, the United States and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12943785/china-unveils-terrifying-new-suicide-drone-swarms/">China </a>have been working on drone swarms.</p>



<p>The use of autonomous weapons has, however, led to concerns about whether the swarms AI means they will commit war crimes.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch is running a campaign called Stop Killer Robots.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are serious doubts that fully autonomous weapons would be capable of meeting international humanitarian law standards,” it says.</p>



<p>These include “the rules of distinction, proportionality, and military necessity, while they would threaten the fundamental right to life and principle of human dignity”. </p>

<p>POLICE are appealing for help after a young Brit mysteriously vanished from her Tokyo apartment four days ago.</p>



<p>Alice Hodgkinson&#8217;s employers alerted authorities when the teacher failed to turn up to work on July 1.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15497971" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 531px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663919610.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=521" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15497971" width="521" height="678" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Facebook</figcredit></figure>Alice Hodgkinson, 28, vanished four days ago in Japan[/caption]

<p>Police scouring her apartment found a note but are refusing share what it says.</p>



<p>The psychology student moved to Japan in March last year and lived and worked in Yokohama, 20 miles south of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/tokyo/">Tokyo</a>.</p>



<p>Dad Stephen called her disappearance &#8220;completely out of character&#8221; and said there was &#8220;no indication that anything was wrong&#8221; when they Skyped each other on June 30.</p>



<p>&#8220;We would hear from her pretty regularly and catch up on Skype, but the first I heard that something was wrong was when the manager of her school called to say that she had missed work for a few days and that they were concerned about her well-being,&#8221; he told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/07/05/police-japan-searching-missing-british-woman/">The Telegraph</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;It came as a bolt out of the blue.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stephen had called his daughter to thank her for a father&#8217;s day present he received.</p>



<p>&#8220;I last spoke to her on the day before she disappeared and there was no indication that anything was wrong,” he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;She had sent me a father’s day present and an e-mail and I wanted to thank her. </p>



<p>“There was nothing out of the ordinary at all, nothing suspicious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alice failed to turn up at Shane Corp, which is a chain of English language schools, on July 1.</p>



<p>The 28-year-old has not been seen by friends for two weeks.</p>

<p><strong>THOUSANDS of dogs were brutally killed as part of the Yulin Dog Meat Festival last month – but the controversial event is far from the only one around the world.</strong></p>



<p>Animal rights activists and celebrities condemned the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15339120/dog-meat-festival-yulin-china-coronavirus-eaten/">annual ‘food’ market</a>, including <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ricky-gervais/">Ricky Gervais</a>, who branded the canine killers “dirty f***ing psychopathic c***s”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/7180914/animal-cruelty-yulin-dog-meat-festival-china/">The Sun revealed the horrors inside a &#8220;secret dog kill farm&#8221;</a>, which supplied &#8216;meat&#8217; to the 10-day festival in Guangxi, China, that celebrates the summer solstice.</p>



<p>Puppies and older canines were believed to be either <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11951078/china-yulin-dog-meat-festival-pups-tortured-boiled-alive/">boiled alive</a> or <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/animal-abuse/">beaten to death</a> before their fur was burned off with a blow-torch – ahead of being consumed. </p>



<p>Humane Society International estimate between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed for meat in China each year.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/peta/">PETA&#8217;s</a> Vice President of International Programmes Mimi Bekhechi told The Sun the event was a &#8220;shameful festival&#8221; and a &#8220;pandemic petri dish&#8221;.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15359471" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000660917415-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15359471" width="960" height="832" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>NoToDogMeat</figcredit></figure>Inside one of the canine kill farms that supplied meat to Yulin Dog Meat Festival[/caption]

<p>PETA urged the public to &#8220;shun&#8221; the event and &#8220;not to pay for profound animal suffering&#8221;. </p>



<p>They call on the public to “stop supporting” any forms of animal suffering that happens anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>Ms Bekhechi told The Sun: &#8220;Dogs suffer beyond imagination for this festival, but we must never forget the pigs, chickens, cows, ducks, and other individuals killed for their flesh all over the world, who also experience pain and fear just as we do.&#8221;</p>



<p>Here are the other barbaric events where animals are tortured and butchered for celebrations.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bull horns set on fire</h2>



<p>Toro Júbilo, dubbed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7791181/distressing-moment-bull-is-set-on-fire-and-taunted-as-it-charges-around-in-agony-at-spanish-festival/">“fire bull” festival</a>, takes place in Medinaceli, Spain, in the second week of November, each year.</p>



<p>The ancient tradition was described as a symbolic ritual that marked the end of the nation&#8217;s 800-year occupation by the Moors, which ended in 1492.</p>



<p>As part of the celebration, a bull is tied down before having balls of tar placed on top of its horn and set alight.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15348835" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-21-at-17.11.29.png?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15348835" width="960" height="485" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Humane Society International</figcredit></figure>Bulls are tied down and then have balls of tar placed on their horns and set alight[/caption]

<p>PETA describes how the “terrified” animal is then released to “run around in a blind terror&#8230; while merciless thugs cheer at his agony&#8221;. </p>



<p>Ms Bekhechi told The Sun: &#8220;The panicked animal can do nothing but charge around the square, smashing into walls in an attempt to put out the flames,&#8221;</p>



<p>Organisers claimed the bull has mud smothered over its head to reduce any pain – but the animal rights groups say the animal&#8217;s &#8220;sensitive horns, eyes and other body parts&#8221; are at risk.</p>



<p>Online PETA branded the event a “sadistic ritual” and “a horrific spectacle that must be banned altogether”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Toro Júbilo, also known as Toro de Fuego, was not allowed to take place last year due to Covid-19 restrictions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Pig blood for &#8216;good luck&#8217;</h2>



<p>Each year, residents of Nem Thuong, a village near Vietnam’s capital Hanoi, carry out a ceremonial slaughtering for ‘good luck’.</p>



<p>The event, which is 800 years old, celebrates General Doan Thuong – who according to legend, killed two wild hogs to feed soldiers fighting off invaders.</p>



<p>Ahead of the day, two pigs are taken care of by local households before being bathed and dyed red for the ceremony.</p>

<p>On the day, the animals are &#8220;tied-up and paraded through the streets&#8221; alongside their executioner, who carries a large blade.</p>



<p>The pigs are “strapped down, spreadeagle” and &#8220;can be heard screaming as their throat is slit and locals dip money in its blood for &#8216;good luck'&#8221;, according to PETA.</p>



<p>Ms Bekhechi told The Sun: &#8220;This is one of the worst “festivals” in the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>But after a crackdown by Vietnamese authorities, the killings now take place in an enclosed courtyard away from public view and no longer are the pigs chopped in half.</p>



<h2>World’s ‘largest animal sacrifice’ fest</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/10476929/gadhimai-hindu-festival-worlds-largest-animal-sacrifice-buffalo-slaughtered/">Gadhimai Festival</a> in Nepal is a two-day festival that happens once every five years.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15349258" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 683px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4c42328b-5b03-42c9-a478-c3f26f0f70ce.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=673" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15349258" width="673" height="428" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Animal Equality</figcredit></figure>One man lines up to attempt to decapitate a bull with a machete[/caption]

<p>The event, which is a celebration observed by some Hindus, was last held in 2019 – despite animal sacrifices being outlawed four years earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Animal Equality estimated that 3,203 buffalos were killed as well as goats, chickens, pigeons and other livestock.</p>



<p>Footage taken by the animal rights group alleged many of the men were “intoxicated” and had “no previous experience”.</p>



<p>This meant many of the animals were not decapitated immediately, which prolonging their suffering.</p>



<p>One-by-one buffaloes were shown being “hacked to death” by worshippers wielding machetes before moving onto other creatures.</p>



<p>At the height of the festival’s popularity in 2009, around 500,000 animals were slaughtered according to Humane Society International.</p>

<p>Estimates from 2014, believe there were between 30,000 and 200,000 animals slaughtered.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Animal piñatas &amp; decapitated ducks&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Kots Kaal Pato, which translates as the “dance of the strangled duck”, was a festival that ran in Citilcum, Mexico, until 2016.</p>



<p>The event was held in honour of Saint Bartolo and was incorrectly believed to bring about the rainy season &#8211; before it was banned in 2016.</p>



<p>The longstanding April celebration saw animals being slaughtered in unusual and cruel ways.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15349389" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-21-at-18.02.01.png?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15349389" width="960" height="494" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Promovision News</figcredit></figure>Men fight to be the first to pull the duck down from a suspended piece of rope[/caption]

<p>According to Vice, iguanas, possums and other “vermin” were captured by children and put into a piñata.</p>



<p>Attendees then took it in turns to pummel the toy – which contained the live animals – with a wooden rod.</p>



<p>Any creatures that were able to “escape the festive deathtrap” were chased by locals and then trampled to death.</p>



<p>In another shocking display, a duck was tied up with rope and suspended from a wooden structure, ready for people to try to grab the bird.</p>



<p>Vice reported “contestants clambering over each other” and jumping to reach it – the event ended after the bird’s head was ripped from its body. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bulls suffocated in &#8217;20-min torture fest&#8217;</h2>



<p>Umkhosi Ukweshwama is a coming of age celebration in South Africa where young men chase a bull around an enclosure and kill it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to The National, it can take more than 20 minutes for the animal to die – typically by being smothered, strangled or having its neck broken.</p>



<h2>Bulls darted &amp; stabbed</h2>



<p>Toro de la Vega, in Spain, is now banned but previously saw one young bull being tortured and killed as part of a medieval tournament that dated back to the 16th century.</p>



<p>The animal would be struck with darts, stabbed with spears and had its tail cut-off before being killed as part of a 500-year-old traditional event.</p>

<p>The individual who landed the final killing blow would be awarded a ceremonial spear and medal.</p>



<p>In 2019, Spain’s Supreme Court rejected an appeal to overturn a ban that prohibited the slaughter of bulls as part of the festival.</p>



<p>While killing is no longer permitted, organisers are allowed to let the riled-up and distressed animal charge through the streets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The council’s rejected appeal argued there were “40,000 fans” of the event “compared to 100 animal activists” who opposed it.</p>



<p>PETA &#8220;celebrated&#8221; the ban of the event and commended 100 other towns in Spain for banning bullfighting.</p>

<h2>Oxen ‘beaten, stabbed &amp; blinded with hot pepper’</h2>



<p>Farra do Boi, which means ‘Festival of the Ox’, used to run from February up until Easter before it was banned in Brazil in 1997.</p>



<p>The event, which led to the painful death of &#8220;countless oxen&#8221;, allegedly still goes on in some parts of the country, according to animal rights activists.</p>



<p>PETA reported animals are starved before being “chased, punched, kicked and beaten” with an array of weapons including “knives, wipes, stones and ropes”.</p>



<p>Shockingly, they allege oxen’s eyes are “rubbed with hot pepper and gouged out” – others are reportedly “doused with gasoline and set on fire”.</p>

<p>In one petition that hoped to end the practice, it was claimed that animals are tortured for up to three days.</p>



<p>Once all the oxen are dead, meat from the animals is then distributed among the participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the beliefs of attendees, the oxen symbolically represented Judas, who “betrayed Jesus and thus must be punished”.</p>

<p>AT LEAST three rockets have hit the Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq, which houses US troops as tensions escalate following American airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias.</p>



<p>US Army Colonel Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the US-led international military coalition, tweeted that initial reports suggested the attack took place at 2.45pm on Monday.</p>

<p>He said the damage was being assessed, but that the rockets landed on the perimeter of the base.</p>



<p>Washington has accused Iran-backed militia groups of launching regular rocket attacks against US troops in Iraq. </p>



<p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday&#8217;s attack, which came days after US forces were fired upon in Syria following airstrikes ordered by President Biden on Iranian-backed militias.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15424992" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000662439313-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15424992" width="960" height="544" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The US Government launched airstrikes on Iran-backed militants last week</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>At the time, Maratto tweeted: &#8220;US Forces in Syria were attacked by multiple rockets. There are no injuries and damage is being assessed. We will provide updates when we have more information.&#8221;</p>



<p>He later added: &#8220;Update: US Forces in Syria, while under multiple rocket attack, acted in self-defense and conducted counter-battery artillery fire at rocket launching positions.&#8221;</p>



<p>A source told CNN the rockets were likely fired by Iranian-backed militias.</p>



<p>The attack took place at site dubbed the &#8220;Green Village&#8221;. The oil field is in the larger security zone where US troops help to protect Syrian fighters.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://the-sun.com/who/joe-biden">Biden</a>&nbsp;administration had launched strikes on two targets in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/syria">Syria</a>&nbsp;and one in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/iraq/">Iraq</a>&nbsp;close to the border on Sunday.</p>



<p>Footage shows US F-15 and F-16 fighter jets carrying out the airstrikes on the militias as they dropped 500-2,000 pound satellite-guided missiles on the targets.</p>



<p>Pilots targeted their drone facilities that were used to attack US troops in Iraq.</p>



<p>Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that the sites targeted were used for “operational and weapons” storage by militia groups including Kata’ib Hezbollah and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada.</p>

<p>He added that the facilities could launch unmanned aerial vehicle attacks against US troops in Iraq.</p>



<p>Kirby said that Biden was protecting the US in carrying out the strikes.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;As demonstrated by this evening’s strikes, President Biden has been clear that he will act to protect US personnel.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Given the ongoing series of attacks by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/iran/">Iran-backed groups</a>&nbsp;targeting US interests in Iraq, the President directed further military action to disrupt and deter such attacks.”</p>



<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday: &#8220;The President&#8217;s view is that it was necessary, appropriate, and a deliberate action&#8230; designed to limit the risk of escalation.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will take, and he believes, we should and will take, necessary appropriate measures to defend US personnel, partners, and allies in the region.&#8221;</p>

<p>CLASSIFIED sections of the Pentagon&#8217;s landmark report on UFO may contain details of alien propulsion tech being probed at Area 51, an investigator has claimed.</p>



<p>US officials released the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15407080/pentagon-accused-of-coverup-for-top-secret-section-omission/">highly anticipated public document</a> after giving a secret briefing to Congress two weeks ago &#8211; but now everyone is asking what is in the full version of the dossier?</p>



<figure id="attachment_14920654" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ab60f2e1-9fb7-43d9-9eef-3fcebbfef372.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-14920654" width="960" height="955" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>US Department of Defense</figcredit></figure>Screenshot from the &#8216;Gimbal&#8217; UFO video which includes US Navy pilots exclaiming &#8216;look at that thing!&#8217;[/caption]



<p>Speculation amongst <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/aliens-ufos/">UFO</a> fans has been running rife as lawmakers and officials have all hinted at potentially significant information compiled in the classified section.</p>



<p>Richard Dolan, an American historian who has researched the topic for 25 years, claims one of his sources provided him with details apparently in the section that was briefed to certain US Congressmen and US Senators. </p>



<p>He alleged the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15398154/pentagon-ufo-report-finally-released-truth-revealed/">classified portion</a> was 70 pages long and included information about advanced &#8211; and potentially alien &#8211; propulsion systems and experimental craft using the tech are being tested at Area 51.</p>



<p>However, he made clear the information was &#8220;unconfirmed&#8221;.</p>



<p>Dismissed as a conspiracy theory for decades, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15176030/ufos-menacing-us-years-government-tracking-ex-pentagon-official/">former US defence officials</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15346298/ufos-undeniable-putin-extraterrestrial-pentagon-report-gop/">sitting politicians</a>, and former presidents <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15135122/obama-ufo-confirmed-new-religions-weapons-stockpiled/">Barack Obama</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15211312/bill-clinton-says-there-are-ufos-flying-around/">Bill Clinton</a> have all acknowledged there is something unusual going on in our skies.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, UFO researcher and professor Bob McGwier claimed 14 videos were shown in the classified briefing &#8211; describing it as like a &#8220;science fiction movie&#8221;. </p>



<p>He claimed officials redacted everything they could from the report &#8211; which saw the public version slashed down to just nine pages.</p>



<p>The dossier however did admit there is something in the skies that cannot be explained &#8211; and did not rule out a potential alien origin. </p>



<p>Dolan claimed his source stated the Pentagon has classified projects investigating &#8220;ET related items&#8221; and &#8220;energy pulse propulsion, ion propulsion, anti-gravity propulsion, anti-matter propulsion&#8221;.</p>



<p>His insider alleged that some of the UFO sightings around Nevada are linked to secretive military base Area 51 as the US carries out secret testing on this unusual tech.</p>



<p>Area 51 has long been the source of speculation &#8211; and its previously been hinted by government insiders that the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14038945/pentagon-admits-testing-wreckage-ufo-crashes/">US may be &#8220;holding and testing&#8221; wreckage from UFOs</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15497269" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 282px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ffgdfgdgfds.png?strip=all&amp;w=272" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15497269" width="272" height="316" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Richard Dolan spoke about claims he had been passed about the &#8216;classified&#8217; section of the UAP report</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>Speaking on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJNbCeE110A&amp;t=2415s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> channel, Dolan said: &#8220;I think all of that actually speaks in a consistent way, in that the authors of this report, they seem genuinely not to believe these objects are of US technology, but even so, I still maintain there&#8217;s no political way in hell that they&#8217;re ever going to say this is US tech.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just way too explosive politically for all kinds of reason. but it may be the case, at least looking at this leaked information, that they may genuinely think it&#8217;s not US tech. That&#8217;s a real possibility. It seems that way to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added he does not believe that the UAPs being probed in the report are secret tech from Russia or China &#8211; as has also been suggested &#8211; describing it as a &#8220;nightmarish propsect&#8221;. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mr McGweir told Spaced Out radio his own account of what was presented in the classified briefing to Congress.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;There were 70 pages and 14 videos, they got to see the good stuff. There was a full classified report and 14 videos. </p>



<p>&#8220;I know several people who were in the national security council meeting and the best comment I heard was ‘what we had was 40 minutes of science fiction movies, we were all gobsmacked’.</p>



<p>“It’s ridiculously slim. Everything they could redact they did but the committees and the White House – they saw the works.”</p>

			<div>
<p>Area 51 is located in the southern portion of&nbsp;<a href="https://the-sun.com/where/nevada/">Nevada</a>, just 83 miles north-northwest of&nbsp;<a href="http://the-sun.com/where/las-vegas/">Las Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>Area 51 is the common name of a highly classified the United States Air Force facility within the Nevada Test and Training Range.</p>
<p>The airbase is commonly believed to be the home of the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems.</p>
<p>The US Air Force acquired the site in 1955, however, the CIA never acknowledged the existence of the facility until June 2013 following a Freedom of Information Act request filed in 2005.</p>
<p>The base has never been declared a secret base, but all research and occurrences in Area 51 are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information.</p>
<p>Some believe the facility is used to store, examine and reverse engineer crashed alien spacecraft, including material supposedly recovered from the 1950s Roswell crash.</p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>Despite not being the full disclosure document some were hoping for &#8211; it did reveal the US military cannot explain 143 out of 144 of sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs).</p>



<p>UAP is now the more common term used to describe the encounters amongst government circles. </p>



<p>Before the release of the report, respected former Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo &#8211; who formerly ran the AATIP programme that investigated UFOs &#8211; said he expected the classified section report to be around 70 pages.  </p>



<p>And following the release of the report there are growing calls of Congressional hearings on the topic. </p>



<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is also expected to update Congress within 90 days, and the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15418185/pentagon-x-files-ufo-office-report-uap/">Pentagon are believed to be setting up a dedicated UFO office</a>. </p>



<p>The report &#8211; officially titled &#8220;Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena&#8221; &#8211;&nbsp;was ordered by Congress as a tacked on addendum to a Covid relief bill back in December.</p>



<p>It was commissioned after the Pentagon took the extraordinary step of confirmed a trio of stunning videos showing encounters with pilots &#8211; admitting they could not explain the phenomena. </p>

<p>NASA chief <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15433931/bill-nelson-nasa-humans-not-alone-ufo-report/">Bill Nelson also said last week</a> he has also read the classified version of the report, but didn&#8217;t gave much intel.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I’ve seen the classified report. It says basically what we thought. We don’t know the answer to what those Navy pilots saw, they know that they saw something, they tracked it, they locked their radar onto it, they followed it, it would suddenly move quickly from one location to another,&#8221; he told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9734025/NASA-official-Bill-Nelson-says-not-universe-reviewing-declassified-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>. </p>



<p>Lawmakers who were briefed on the classified version of the report have also spoken out &#8211; not giving details, but suggesting they want more information. </p>



<p>Democratic congressman Andre Carson told CBS: &#8220;&#8221;The report is inconclusive. What we do know is that &#8230; there have been nearly 150 sightings. </p>



<p>&#8220;80 of those sightings have been detected with some of the best technology the world has ever seen.</p>



<p>&#8220;And <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15492922/rep-demands-hearings-on-ufo-sightings/">we can&#8217;t rule out something that&#8217;s otherworldly</a>, but that&#8217;s a very small percentage.&#8221;</p>



<p>And fellow Democrat congressman Mike Quigley said: &#8220;The stigma is gone. Now that’s as big a change in policy as I’ve witnessed about this issue in my lifetime. </p>



<p>&#8220;So the fact that they are taking this sort of thing seriously for the first time, I think, is important.&#8221;</p>

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					UFOS have stepped from fringe conspiracy theories to a genuine national security debate in the US.				</p>

			<div>
<p>Pentagon officials last year took the unprecedented step to confirm a trio of remarkable videos which showed US encounters with UFOs.</p>
<p>The debate is still open as to what the phenomena caught on film were – but it made clear to everyone, something is in the skies.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the “Tic Tac” – which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes.</p>
<p>The US also confirmed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) – a Pentagon programme set up to study UFOs before being disbanded in 2017.</p>
<p>However, it was replaced by the UAP Task Force in June 2020 after a vote by the US Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>Defence chiefs have since confirmed a number of leaked UFO videos and photos which were submitted to the Task Force for investigation.</p>
<p>Why this sudden rush for transparency?</p>
<p>No outside the secretive wings of the US government currently knows for sure.</p>
<p>And as a tacked on addendum to a 5,500 page Covid relief bill passed in December, the the Director of National Intelligence’s office was ordered to compile a report on UFOs within 180 days.</p>
<p>The UAP report dropped as expected on June 25, and while not giving much away &#8211; it did not rule anything out either as much of it remains classified.</p>
<p>The US appear to have acknowledged that UFOs &#8211; whatever they are &#8211; are real and are a potential threat to national security as they appear to be able to enter restricted airspace with total impunity.</p>
<p>Is it aliens? Officially the US position is simply, &#8220;we don&#8217;t know yet&#8221; as further disclosure is expected in the coming months and years.</p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>Congressman Patrick Maloney added: &#8220;We take the issue of unexplained aerial phenomena seriously to the extent that we’re dealing with the safety and security of US military personnel or the national security interests of the United States, so we want to know what we’re dealing with</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it’s important to understand that there are legitimate questions involving the safety and security of our personnel, and in our operations and in our sensitive activities, and we all know that there’s [a] proliferation of technologies out there</p>



<p>&nbsp;And intelligence committee chairman Democrat rep Adam Schiff said: &#8220;It was an interesting briefing. </p>



<p>&#8220;I did learn things that were certainly new to me. But I think I’m going to leave it at that.”</p>



<p>US lawmakers commissioned the report after a stunning string of leaked videos which showed military encounters with objects such as the infamous &#8220;Tic Tac&#8221;.</p>



<p>It marked an incredible turnaround after the government dismissed UFOs at the conclusion of Project Blue Book in the 1960s.</p>



<p>And former Pentagon insider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15407080/pentagon-accused-of-coverup-for-top-secret-section-omission/">Elizondo confirmed much of the report is likely still hidden</a>&nbsp;&#8211; and rumours of other stunning photos and videos.</p>



<p>“The government has formally and officially come out and informed Congress that these things are – A, they’re real – and two, that they’re not ours and that they seem to be performing, at least some of them … in remarkable ways,” Elizondo told Fox News.</p>

<p>Some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15408498/pentagon-ufo-report-whitewash-coverup-aliens/">unhappy UFO fans branded the report a &#8220;whitewash&#8221;</a>, but it is seen by many as the first step on the road to truly understanding what is going on in the skies.</p>



<p>The report admits the encounters could be previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15399403/pentagon-ufo-report-secret-aircraft-china-russia/">unknown aircraft from China, Russia or event a &#8220;non government&#8221; terror group</a>.</p>



<p>But it crucially did not rule out an extraterrestrial, or perhaps even extradimensional, origin for the encounters.</p>



<p>The Sun Online previously revealed the Pentagon is believed to have in its possession a picture of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15367584/pentagon-black-triangle-ufo-photo-fighter-pilot/">&#8220;Black Triangle&#8221; UFO rising from the ocean</a>&nbsp;in one of the most stunning encounters ever caught on camera.</p>

<p>TALIBAN leaders will treat Nato and US forces as &#8216;invaders&#8217; if they fail to leave Afghanistan by September, a spokesperson has said.</p>



<p>Suhail Shaheen promised the Taliban &#8220;would react&#8221; if troops are left in the country after withdrawal, hours after the movement seized control of nine districts.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they leave behind their forces against the Doha agreement then in that case it will be the decision of our leadership how we proceed,&#8221; he said, referring to the US-Taliban peace agreement brokered last year.</p>



<p>&#8220;We would react and the final decision is with our leadership,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>He promised diplomats, NGOs and foreign civilians wouldn&#8217;t be targeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are against the foreign military forces, not diplomats, NGOs and workers and NGOs functioning and embassies functioning &#8211; that is something our people need. We will not pose any threat to them,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Talibani forces have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15467931/afghanistan-isis-taliban-seize-us-military-vehicle/">unleashed a reign of terror in recent weeks</a>&nbsp;and seized control of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15467931/afghanistan-isis-taliban-seize-us-military-vehicle/">a third of the country after American troops began to withdraw</a>.</p>



<p>The Afghan Ministry of Defense said at least 143 insurgents were killed and 121 others wounded in counter-attacks in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Fawad Aman, a deputy spokesman for the ministry said that the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces are in an “assaulting mood and are conducting operations against the Taliban”.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a key Taliban commander was killed in western Herat province on Saturday night.</p>



<p>Despite this, the jihadis are now preparing to move on the capital Kabul after Afghan troops surrendered and retreated.</p>



<p>Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said seizing Kabul militarily was &#8220;not Taliban policy&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he did say that no foreign forces, including military contractors, should remain in the capital after withdrawal was complete.</p>



<p>February 2020 saw a peace deal signed between the US and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, which agreed to a withdrawal by September 11, 2021.</p>



<p>Taliban forces have since continued their operations and have been gaining ground &#8211; and the US continues to pull back its troops.</p>



<p>As a result, 300 Afghan military personnel fled into neighbouring Tajikistan to escape the group&#8217;s advance.</p>



<p>The Islamist group seized hundreds of trucks, armoured vehicles and artillery from Afghan security forces — which had been left by departing American forces.</p>



<p>An investigation of imagery posted on social media concludes that in the month of June alone the militants captured 700 vehicles.</p>



<p>It mirrors the seizure of military hardware of the US-backed Iraqi government by ISIS in the mid 2010s, which enabled it to take over vast tracks of the country and form its so-called caliphate.</p>



<p>Some 456 British soldiers and 2,420 Americans &#8211; along with hundreds of other coalition troops &#8211; died during the war which was sparked by the September 11 attacks.</p>

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					US forces have begun a full withdrawal from Afghanistan under the orders of US President Joe Biden after spending 20 years fighting to stablise the war-torn nation. 				</p>

			<div>
<p>Some 456 British soldiers and 2,420 Americans &#8211; along with hundreds of other coalition troops &#8211; died during the war which was sparked by the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And the civilian casualties are estimated to have been almost 50,000.</p>
<p>Codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom, the US led an invasion off Afghanistan to oust the Taliban after al-Qaeda flew planes into the World Trade Centre and other US buildings in 2001.</p>
<p>The mission was to oust the Taliban, who were said to be harbouring terrorists and providing them a safe haven  &#8211; including Osama bin Laden. </p>
<p>What followed was nearly 20 years of grinding conflict as the US, its allies, and the Afghan security forces staged a grinding campaign to attempt to rebuild the country and beat back the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Taliban had ruled most of Afghanistan following the Afghan Civil War in the 90s &#8211; sparked by the withdrawal of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Western nations had actually supported the Taliban in the 80s as the ran an insurgency against the Soviet backed regime of Mohammad Najibullah. </p>
<p>However, after seizing power in 1996 &#8211; the Taliban brutally ruled Afghanistan and offered a safe haven to terrorist killers like Osama.</p>
<p>As the US war rolled on into the 2010s, Bin Laden was killed in May, 2011, in a US special forces raid in Abbotabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p>And since then there has been a slow withdrawal, with British troops officially ending combat operations in October 2014.</p>
<p>February 2020 saw a peace deal signed between the US and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, which agreed to a withdrawal &#8211; whoever the Afghan government criticised it as being done behind &#8220;closed doors&#8221;. </p>
<p>Taliban forces have since continued their operations and have been gaining ground &#8211; and the US continues to pull back its troops. </p>
<p>The war is seen as defeating the Taliban and improving the lives of the Afghan people who were once living under strict Islamic law and who now have free elections.</p>
<p>However, for some it is unfinished job which was mishandled &#8211; and that may 20 years on simply see a return to the dominance of the Taliban as they did pre-9/11.</p>

<p>Codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom, the US led an invasion off Afghanistan to oust the Taliban after al-Qaeda flew planes into the World Trade Centre and other US buildings in 2001.</p>



<p>The mission was to oust the Taliban, who were said to be harbouring terrorists and providing them a safe haven &#8211; including Osama bin Laden.</p>



<p>What followed was nearly 20 years of grinding conflict as the US, its allies, and the Afghan security forces staged a grinding campaign to attempt to rebuild the country and beat back the Taliban.</p>

<p><strong>GUNMEN have allegedly kidnapped babies and nurses from hospital, as militants snatch 140 children from a Nigerian school.</strong></p>



<p>The horror incident &#8211; the latest in a wave of abductions targeting schoolchildren and students &#8211;&nbsp; took place at the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Centre in Zaria, early on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Heavily-armed criminal gangs frequently ambush villages and proceed to steal cattle, loot homes and abduct for ransom, in northwest and central Nigeria.</p>



<p>Since the start of the year, they have increasingly targeted schools and colleges.</p>



<p>Gunmen scaled a fence to break into the Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna state in the early hours of Monday, taking away most of the 165 pupils boarding overnight.</p>



<p>&#8220;The kidnappers took away 140 students, only 25 students escaped. We still have no idea where the students were taken,&#8221; Emmanuel Paul, a teacher at the school told AFP.</p>



<p>The mother of a 15-year-old girl who was kidnapped from Bethel Baptist School told the BBC that a large group of armed men had arrived on motorbikes and broken down the fence, before seizing the schoolchildren.</p>



<p>Kaduna state police spokesman Mohammed Jalige confirmed the early Monday morning attack, however could not give details on the number of pupils taken.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tactical police teams went after the kidnappers,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jalige confirmed police were “still on” the rescue mission.</p>



<p>The gunmen who attacked the hospital in Zaria reportedly opened fire on a police station in the city beforehand.</p>



<p>Another group attacked the hospital while police were engaged by the shootout. </p>



<p>&#8220;The attack on the police station was a distraction whilst another group attacked the dormitories of the health centre workers,&#8221; a local resident told AFP news agency.</p>



<p>The group escaped with the victims into a nearby forest.</p>



<p>It was not yet known who was behind the abductions.</p>



<p>Bethel Baptits High School is a co-education college located in Maramara village in Chikun district, outside Nigeria’s state capital Kaduna.</p>



<p>Monday’s attack was the fourth mass school kidnap in the state since December.</p>



<p>Around 1,000 students and pupils have been abducted in different Nigerian states since December last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most have been released after negotiations with local officials, although some of these are still being held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around 1,000 students and pupils have been abducted in different Nigerian states since December last year. Most have been released after negotiations with local officials, although some are still being held.</p>



<p>Nine of these students were killed.</p>



<p>More armed groups had resorted to mass abduction of students, since the well-publicised <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14171563/armed-gunmen-abducted-300-girls-boarding-school-nigeria/">abduction in 2014 of 276 schoolgirls</a> from Chibok secondary school by Boko Haram Islamist militants in Borno state.</p>



<p>The girls were kept prisoner for three years, after being snatched from a school in the north-eastern town of Chibok in April 2014.</p>



<p>Government ministers confirmed the girls were <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3499666/chibok-schoolgirls-released-boko-haram/">finally freed on Saturday 6 May 2017 in exchange for five high-ranking Boko Haram prisoners</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Boko Haram warlord Abubakar Shekau is said to have <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15186744/warlord-leader-boko-haram-dead-clash-nigeria/">blown himself up</a> back in May,&nbsp;as he was hunted down by rival terror group Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap), which is now poised to dominate the region.</p>

<p>Iswap claimed they had orders to kill Shekau from ISIS commanders in the Middle East, who were concerned at his indiscriminate killing of Muslims.</p>

<p><strong>A SLIMMED down Kim Jong-un has purged dozens of officials for their “disastrous failings” over the country’s famine.</strong></p>



<p>The North Korean leader seems to have resumed a reign of terror, by axing the officials over his own disastrous failings amid a growing food shortage.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15495515" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000653665324.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15495515" width="960" height="636" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Credit: Pen News</figcredit></figure>North Korea faces a crisis across its agricultural sector[/caption]



<p>The cuts come as images of the new &#8220;slim Kim&#8221; emerge, following reports that the fridge-loving leader had<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15210447/new-pics-show-kim-jong-un-lost-weight/"> piled on the pounds</a> while a famine rages on in his rogue state.</p>



<p>According to one source, 5ft 6ins Kim&#8217;s cronies say he gained weight due to work-related stress, drinking, heavy <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12502885/kim-jong-un-cigarette-warns-coronavirus-health-coma/">smoking and a high-fat diet</a>.</p>



<p>Those close to the North Korean despot are said to have pleaded with the heavy smoker to get fit and &#8220;take some rest&#8221; for the &#8220;good of his people&#8221;.</p>



<p><a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/06/29/2021062901199.html">Chosun Media reports</a> he was eventually persuaded to head to a secretive health retreat after an intervention by key officials.</p>



<p>But starving North Koreans are now <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15414423/north-korea-emaciated-kim-jong-un-media/">reportedly worried about the health of their &#8220;emaciated&#8221; leader</a>, according to state media.Aanalysts say the broadcast just shows the Pyongyang propaganda machine is trying to use Kim&#8217;s weight to reinforce loyalty to the regime in desperate times.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, recent editions of the official Rodong Sinmun, the North Korean newspaper that serves as the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, has published warning messages about loyalty.</p>



<p>The warnings followed Kim firing several senior officials, for causing a “crisis” in the fight against coronavirus and a battle to combat the famine.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15495522" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 925px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000657075676.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=915" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15495522" width="915" height="488" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>KCTV</figcredit></figure>The dictator has slimmed down from his hefty 22 stone[/caption]



<p>According to reports from <a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/07/05/2021070501021.html">The Shozunilbo</a>, the paper said on Sunday that who is a loyal subject “becomes clearer on times of hardship”.</p>



<p>An editorial last week warned officials would end up “losers of the revolution” if they failed to maintain discipline.</p>



<p>&#8220;While mistakes made in the process are forgivable, causing critical harm to our party, country and people due to irresponsibility and negligence of duty is never acceptable,” it said.</p>



<p>Speaking at a meeting of the ruling Workers&#8217; party on Tuesday, Kim accused officials of &#8220;causing a grave incident that poses a huge crisis to the safety of the nation and its people&#8221;, state news agency Korean Central News Agency said.</p>



<p>One of those officials axed was a member of the top standing committee of the politburo, which only has five members &#8211; including Kim himself.</p>



<p>And North Korea’s 37-year-old dictator had chaired three extended Workers Party meetings in the first half of this year alone &#8211; a move which is highly unusual.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t confirmed if the shake-ups were related to the handling of the pandemic, nor the famine.</p>



<p>Kim called the meeting to deal with &#8220;chronic irresponsibility and incompetence&#8221; in the top ranks and blasted bureaucrats for &#8220;passiveness in planning and executing anti-virus measures amid the lengthening pandemic&#8221;.</p>



<p>The report did not elaborate on the nature of the &#8220;crisis&#8221; &#8211; or how the incident put North Koreans at risk.</p>



<p>Kim Jong Un last month<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15330963/north-korea-will-run-out-of-food-in-two-months-amid-fears-kim-jong-un-faces-repeat-of-famine-that-killed-millions/"> addressed the growing crisis </a>in his country’s agricultural sector on Tuesday, admitting the situation was “getting tense”.</p>



<p>The despot also said the state-run economy cannot feed its citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent reports from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) said North Korea had just two months of supplies left.</p>



<p>While the price of essentials like rice and fuel have reportedly held firm,&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/18/asia/north-korea-united-states-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN</a>&nbsp;reports citizens in the state’s capital Pyongyang are paying triple the regular price for potatoes, and £50 for some teabags.</p>



<p>So far, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/">North Korea</a> has claimed to have zero Covid cases, despite testing thousands and sharing a border with China.</p>



<p>Despite confirming no cases, the reclusive country has brought in strict lockdown measures, including border closures and domestic travel curbs, pointing to concerns over the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>And the country declared a state of emergency and locked down the border city of Kaesong last year after a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the border with symptoms of Covid.</p>



<p>The lockdown has strained an economy already battered by decades of mismanagement and crippling US-led sanctions over the country&#8217;s nuclear weapons program.</p>



<p>During a meeting earlier this month, Kim warned officials to brace for more Covid restrictions, suggesting the country isn&#8217;t ready to open its borders anytime soon.</p>

<p>TOP health officials say there will be &#8220;a lot more dead people&#8221; if countries continue to ease Covid restrictions.</p>



<p>Epidemiologists are worried that plans to downgrade Covid to a &#8220;seasonal flu&#8221; will lead to a new wave of deaths.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15495380" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000663890306.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15495380" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Reuters</figcredit></figure>Top scientists warn easing Covid restrictions will lead to &#8216;a lot more dead people&#8217;[/caption]



<figure id="attachment_15495492" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/abbb33c0-c6a4-461a-9153-0d360833d2c7.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15495492" width="960" height="634" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Aussie epidemiologists say it&#8217;s too early to go back to &#8216;normal life&#8217;</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>



<p>The warning comes as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/australia/">Aussie</a> Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed Covid will be treated &#8220;like the flu&#8221; once vaccination rates in the country hit 80 per cent.</p>



<p>&#8220;We get this done, Australia, and you can see what’s on the other side,&#8221; he said introducing the country&#8217;s roadmap out of lockdown.</p>



<p>&#8220;When it is like the flu, we should treat it like the flu and that means no lockdowns&#8221;.</p>



<p>Under the four-stage plan, Aussies can expect lockdowns to be a thing of the past and boarders to open up 2022.</p>



<p>The Pacific nation currently has once of the strictest quarantine regimes around, requiring arrivals to self-isolate in a hotel for two weeks and prohibiting Aussies from leaving the country without permission.</p>



<p>But senior health officials warn the proposals will lead to &#8220;a lot more dead people&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We could live just our normal lives, but I just think we’d have a lot more dead people,&#8221; said professor Nancy Baxter from the University of Melbourne&#8217;s global health department.</p>



<p>Diseases expert Suman Majumdar said it would be a mistake to &#8220;just let the virus go&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Rather than the flu, I would say measles might be more similar, because measles is catastrophic if it is rampant in an unvaccinated population.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a stark warning to fellow citizens, Majumdar said mask-wearing will be in place for &#8220;some period of time&#8221;, especially in high-risk places like buses, trains and cramped indoor environments.</p>



<p>The comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells Brits to learn <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15493768/hospitals-cope-rise-cases-freedom-day-live-covid-nhs/">learn to live with covid as a simple fact of life</a>.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/boris-johnson/">Prime Minister</a>&nbsp;is expected to say that<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15494242/boris-johnson-announcement-today-coronavirus-uk-news-facemasks-july/"> from July 19, covid face mask rules will be scrapped</a>, with the UK switching to a voluntary system, and urge workers to return to the office.</p>



<p>Canberra&#8217;s announcement comes as the Delta variant rips through Sydney, forcing the city into a snap two-week lockdown.</p>



<p>New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said: &#8220;What we are really looking at are the number of people who have still been infectious in the community and what impact that will have in the next few days.&#8221;</p>



<p>So far, at least 300 people have been infected since the first case&nbsp;was reported on June 16.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next couple of days will be absolutely critical,&#8221; Berejiklian said.</p>



<p>This year, Australia recorded just over 2000 cases of COVID-19, with one death from a person who had returned from overseas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Health authorities around the world are on high alert after the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15493742/lambda-variant-could-be-deadlier-than-delta/">World Health Organisation</a> <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15493742/lambda-variant-could-be-deadlier-than-delta/">warned the new &#8220;Lambda&#8221; variant could be more infectious</a> than current strains.</p>



<p>The WHO classified Lambda as a global&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14004782/covid-variants-uk-symptoms-philippines-strain/">Variant of Interest</a>&nbsp;on 14 June.</p>



<p>Mutations in the strain increase transmissibility and potentially dodge vaccines, it warned before adding there was not enough evidence to know for certain.</p>



<p>&#8220;So far we have seen no indication that the Lambda variant is more aggressive,&#8221; the WHO virologist Jairo Mendez-Rico told German news outlet DW.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s possible that it has a higher rate of contagion but more work needs to be done on it.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will become more transmissible throughout the course of its evolution but not necessarily more damaging to the host.&#8221;</p>



<p>This comes as<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15469863/fears-over-the-lambda-covid-variant-in-uk/"> Chilean researchers found the variant could be resistant to Covid vaccines</a>.</p>



<p>Experts at the University of Chile who studied the virus in local healthcare workers who received two doses of China&#8217;s CoronaVac jab say Lambda is more infectious than the Brazilian and UK mutations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our data show for the first time that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant confer escape to neutralising antibodies and increased infectivity,” they wrote in a paper yet to be peer reviewed.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is possible that it may exhibit higher infection rates, but we don&#8217;t yet have enough reliable data to compare it to gamma or delta.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also known as C.37, the Lambda&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">strain</a>&nbsp;was first detected in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/peru/">Peru</a>&nbsp;last year before quickly spreading to 30 countries, including Britain.</p>



<p>Of particular concern to virologists is the L452Q spike protein&nbsp;because of its potential to infect human cells like the L452R mutation in the highly infectious Delta variant.</p>



<p>Peruvian scientists noticed the variant in December when it accounted for “just one in every 200 samples”.</p>



<p>By March, that jumped to 50 per cent of cases. Now that figure is a whopping 82 per cent, according to the WHO.</p>

<p>A SURFER was rushed to hospital after being savaged by a shark at a beach in Australia today.</p>



<p>Shocking pictures from the scene show a huge chunk bitten from the victim&#8217;s surfboard at Crescent Head, 250 miles north of Sydney.</p>

<p>Life guards said the 20-year-old surfer was mauled at around 4.30pm local time on Monday.</p>



<p>He was treated at the scene for a severe arm injury before being flown to hospital by air ambulance, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/animals/man-attacked-by-shark-at-crescent-head-beach-on-nsw-mid-north-coast/news-story/ea4462d4b28b211cda28e811d520d097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports News.com.au</a>.</p>



<p>Crescent Head and Killick beaches &#8211; popular spots for water sports &#8211; were closed after the attack.</p>



<p>It comes six weeks after a &#8220;hero&#8221; dad was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15000810/daughter-hero-surfer-shark-heart-ocean/">killed by a 15ft suspected great white shark</a> while surfing at nearby Tuncurry beach.</p>



<p>Mark Sanguinetti, 59, from Sydney, was mauled on the thigh after trying to warn his three pals of the danger.</p>



<p>A witness said: &#8220;The shark came out of the water, just smashed him, five seconds later he came round and hit him again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Beach-goers <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/14989644/surfer-mauled-death-great-white-shark-onlookers-aussie-coast/">hauled Mark out of the water</a> but he could not be saved.</p>



<p>His devastated daughter said: &#8220;We all knew him as a legend with a heart as vast and deep as the ocean, which was the first of his many loves.&#8221;</p>



<p>Several beaches were closed in the wake of that attack on May 18.</p>

<p>Last month a boy of ten was badly injured by a 7ft bronze whaler shark in remote Western Australia, near Coral Bay.</p>



<p>His dad <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15249320/boy-10-attacked-two-metre-shark-snorkelling-australia/">fought off the predator with a spear gun</a>, according to reports.</p>



<p>That was the second such attack in the area after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14484811/shark-savaged-fisherman-punched-beast-in-face/">fisherman Jack Howson, 27, punched a shark</a> that mauled his calf in March.</p>



<p>In January, dad Duncan Craw, 32, was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13858054/missing-surfer-body-mauled-shark-australia/">mauled to death while snorkelling</a> on a family camping holiday in Port Macdonnell, South Australia.</p>



<p>Last year Australia recorded its highest number of fatal shark attacks for almost 100 years.</p>

<p>She featured on X-rated Western sites such as Pornhub under her nickname Kris the foxx, and was also a star on OnlyFans.</p>



<p>Her body was found near a high residential block in the Nevsky district, and a coin was in her hand engraved with the words: “You are always in my heart.”</p>



<p>Haunting CCTV footage shows Kristina walking up the steps to the block apparently eating a bag of crisps shortly before her fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It then shows her go into the building before pressing a button to call the lift, which she enters.</p>



<p>Friends said she had recently suffered from “loneliness” and wanted to start a family. </p>

<p>“She wanted to have a family and be loved.”</p>



<p>Kristina, from Siberia, had said in an interview that she went into the porn industry after failing to find her way working in a bank.</p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t understand what to talk about with these people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing a report by <a href="https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/global/covid19-uk-strain-more-transmissible-than-delta-hits-uk/news-story/4680c0a91a079cc00143cfdddddb20ba">news.com.au</a>, the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/malaysia/">Malaysian</a> Health Ministry said Peru was now experiencing &#8220;the highest mortality rate in the world,” in a tweet on Monday.</p>



<p>&#8220;A new strain said to be more dangerous than the Delta variant has reportedly been detected in more than 30 countries over the past 4 weeks,&#8221; it said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Lambda strain is reported to originate from Peru, the country with the highest mortality rate in the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lambda is running rampant in the South American country, contributing to some 500 deaths per 100,000 people &#8211; almost double that of second-placed Hungary, which is seeing 300 per 100,000 people die from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins data.</p>



<p>This comes as Chilean researchers found the variant could be resistant to Covid vaccines.</p>



<p>Experts at the University of Chile who studied the virus in local healthcare workers who received two doses of China&#8217;s CoronaVac jab say Lambda is more infectious than the Brazilian and UK mutations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our data show for the first time that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant confer escape to neutralising antibodies and increased infectivity,” they wrote in a paper yet to be peer reviewed.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is possible that it may exhibit higher infection rates, but we don&#8217;t yet have enough reliable data to compare it to gamma or delta.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also known as C.37, the Lambda&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">strain</a>&nbsp;was first detected in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/peru/">Peru</a>&nbsp;last year before quickly spreading to 30 countries, including Britain.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15469863/fears-over-the-lambda-covid-variant-in-uk/">Of particular concern to virologists is the L452Q spike protein</a> because of its potential to infect human cells like the L452R mutation in the highly infectious Delta variant.</p>



<p>Peruvian scientists noticed the variant in December when it accounted for “just one in every 200 samples”.</p>



<p>By March, that jumped to 50 per cent of cases. Now that figure is a whopping 82 per cent, according to the WHO.</p>



<p>Pablo Tsukayama, a molecular scientist at the Cayetano Heredia university in Lima said the virus&#8217; rapid rise &#8220;would suggest its rate of transmission is higher than other variants&#8221;.</p>



<p>In neighbouring Chile, it accounts for almost a third of cases, though scientists are unable to say which the strain is more transmissible.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15394601/new-covid-variant-lambda-uk/">Six cases have already been reported in the UK</a> &#8211; all of which were linked to overseas travel.</p>



<p>Public Health England declared it as a Covid Variant Under Investigation.</p>

<p>An &#8220;unusual set of mutations&#8221; have made testing the virus&#8217; virulence hard to do, says top science director Jeff Barrett.</p>



<p>He also worried a lack of gene sequencing labs in South America has allowed the virus to spread almost undetected.</p>



<p>The World Health Organisation classified Lambda as a global <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14004782/covid-variants-uk-symptoms-philippines-strain/">Variant of Interest</a>&nbsp;on 14 June.</p>



<p>WHO said it has mutations that increases transmissibility and potentially dodge vaccines, although there is not enough evidence to know for certain.</p>



<p>&#8220;So far we have seen no indication that the lambda variant is more aggressive,&#8221; the WHO virologist Jairo Mendez-Rico told German news outlet DW.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s possible that it has a higher rate of contagion but more work needs to be done on it.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will become more transmissible throughout the course of its evolution but not necessarily more damaging to the host.&#8221;</p>



<p>Health officials hope vaccines combined with people becoming resistant to the virus after being infected will stop the spread.</p>



<p>Peru overtook Brazil as having the world&#8217;s worst per capita Covid death toll.</p>



<p>Health officials in the country tripled the official Covid death toll to 180,764, up from 69,342 after a government review found cases were not being properly recorded.</p>



<p>Peru has been one of the hardest hit countries in Latin America, with hospitals overrun and with demand for oxygen sending supplies plummeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;We think it is our duty to make public this updated information,&#8221; said the Peruvian prime minister, Violeta Bermúdez, at a news conference announcing the result of the review.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is being said is that a significant number of deaths were not classified as caused by Covid-19,&#8221; the health minister, Óscar Ugarte, said.</p>



<p>Though Brazil has the highest total Covid-19 death toll with more than 450,000 lives lost, based on population, Peru&#8217;s tally is more than double its Amazon neighbour. </p>

<p><strong>RUSSIAN hackers REvil have demanded a $70 million ransom in Bitcoin for a decryption key, after a cyberattack that targeted 1,000 US firms.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The breach, which is the<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3213489/biden-weak-putin-companies-cyberattack-july-4/"> largest ransomware attack</a> on record, has reportedly hit the IT systems of up to 1 million companies across the globe, by breaching the systems of US-based software firm Kaseya.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15494033" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000661694998-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15494033" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>The attack, which happened on Friday, was among the most dramatic hacks ever seen[/caption]



<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GL-COMP-GLOBAL-revil-cyber-attacks-v3-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15494150" width="960" height="822" />



<p>Those affected included a school in New Zealand and Swedish grocery chain Coop. as well as two major Dutch IT firms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the hackers suspected to be behind the mass extortion attack late on Sunday demanded $70 million to restore the data they are holding ransom &#8211; according to a posting on a dark web site.</p>



<p>The hackers reportedly later lowered their demands, asking for $50 million rather than the original $70m.</p>



<p>The group said: &#8220;We launched an attack on MSP providers. More than a million systems were infected. </p>



<p>&#8220;If anyone wants to negotiate about universal decryptor &#8211; our price is 70 000 000$ in BTC and we will publish publicly decryptor.&#8221;</p>



<p>The demand was posted on a blog typically used by the REvil cybercrime gang &#8211; a group with links to Russia, that is considered to be among the cybercriminal world’s most prolific extortionists.</p>



<p>The structure of the gang makes it occasionally difficult to determine who speaks on the hackers’ behalf.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Allan Liska of cybersecurity firm Recorded Future told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/hackers-demand-70-million-liberate-data-held-by-companies-hit-mass-cyberattack-2021-07-05/">Reuters </a>the message “almost certainly” came from REvil’s core leadership.</p>



<p>The attack, which happened on Friday, was among the most dramatic hacks ever seen, among a series of increasingly attention-grabbing moves from cyberhackers.</p>



<p>US President Joe Biden was on Saturday branded “weak” against Vladimir Putin, after hundreds of US companies were hit by the breach.</p>



<p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted on the weekend: &#8220;Remember when <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/who/joe-biden/">President Biden</a> gave Putin a list of things that were supposed to be off-limits for cyber attacks? What he SHOULD have said is that ALL American targets are off-limits.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Republican added: &#8220;Biden is soft on crime and weak against <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3077896/putin-russia-cyber-attacks-alexei-navalny-jail/">Putin</a>.&#8221;</p>

<figure id="attachment_15494032" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000653907699.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15494032" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Alamy</figcredit></figure>At least 200 companies were initially thought to be paralyzed on Friday &#8211; though later reports put this figure closer to 1,000[/caption]



<p>Biden had said the intel community is &#8220;unsure if Russia is to blame&#8221; for the ransomware attack.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re not sure it’s the Russians. I directed the intelligence community to give me a deep dive on what&#8217;s happened, and I&#8217;ll know better tomorrow,&#8221; the president said.</p>



<p>But he did warn: &#8220;If it is either with the knowledge of and/or a consequence of <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/russia/">Russia</a>, then I told Putin we will respond.&#8221;</p>



<p>John Hammond, of the security firm Huntress Labs, said REvil gang, a major Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate, appears to be behind the attack.</p>



<p>Labeling it &#8220;a colossal and devastating supply chain attack,&#8221; Hammond said the criminals targeted a software supplier called Kaseya.</p>



<p>They then used its network-management package to spread the ransomware through cloud-service providers, Hammond said.</p>



<p>Other researchers agree with that assessment.</p>



<p>James Shank, of threat intelligence firm Team Cymru, said &#8220;it’s reasonable to think that the timing was planned” to coincide with the Fourth of July.</p>



<p>At least 200 companies were initially thought to be paralyzed on Friday,&nbsp; according to a cybersecurity researcher whose company was responding to the incident.</p>



<p>Later reports put that figure closer to the 1,000 mark, with a map showing the spread of the intrusion still coming into focus.</p>

<p>REvil is a Russian-speaking hacking gang, which emerged in 2019.</p>
<p>The group is said to earn more than $100 million a year.</p>
<p>The group, which is also known as Sodinokobi, is known to target huge global companies, and demands to be paid in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>REvil has a page on the dark web called Happy Blog, where it has previously leaked sensitive information from the companies it targets.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the group has links to Russsian officials.</p>

<p>The disruption spilled into the public domain when Swedish Coop grocery store chain was forced to close hundreds of stores on Saturday &#8211; when its cash registers had been knocked offline as a consequence of the attack.</p>



<p>Those hit included schools, small public-sector bodies, travel and leisure organisations, as well as credit unions and accountants.</p>



<p>However, Allan Liska believed the hackers may have bitten off more than they could chew by scrambling the data of hundreds of companies at a time.</p>



<p>The huge $70 million demand was an effort to make the best of an awkward situation, he said.</p>



<p>The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement late Friday that it is closely monitoring the situation and working with the FBI to collect more information about its impact.</p>



<p>CISA urged anyone who might be affected to “follow Kaseya’s guidance to shut down VSA servers immediately.”</p>



<p>Kaseya runs what’s called a virtual system administrator, or VSA, that’s used to remotely manage and monitor a customer’s network.</p>



<p>Biden last month said he had given Putin a list of 16 American entities that are &#8220;off-limits.&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking with reporters, he said: &#8220;I talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off-limits to attack – period – by cyber or any other means.</p>



<p>&#8220;I gave them a list – 16 specific entities; 16 defined as critical infrastructure under US policy, from the energy sector to our water systems.&#8221;</p>



<p>That came following two cyberattacks on Colonial Pipeline and meat-processer JBS Holdings.</p>



<p>Both companies reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms to regain access to their systems, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-putin-russian-cyberattacks-list-16-off-limits-criticism">Fox News</a> reports.</p>



<p>Active since April 2019, the group known as REvil provides ransomware-as-a-service.</p>

<p>That means it develops network-paralyzing software and leases it out to those who infect targets and earn the lion’s share of ransoms.</p>

<p>THE Pope is &#8220;responding well&#8221; in hospital after a stomach operation over the weekend, the Vatican has confirmed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/pope-francis/">Pope Francis</a> was was admitted to Gemelli University Hospital in Rome for a scheduled op on his large intestine.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15492381" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/08f2793b-df19-4d83-9900-61a61de04277.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15492381" width="960" height="880" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Rex</figcredit></figure>Pope Francis was admitted to hospital for stomach surgery over the weekend[/caption]



<p>Spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that the pontiff &#8220;responded well&#8221; to the surgery, which was done under general anaesthesia.</p>



<p>The 84-year-old had been cheerfully greeting the public in the Vatican’s St Peter’s Square three hours before being taken in.</p>



<p>This is the first time the Catholic leader has been admitted to hospital since he was made Pope in 2013.</p>



<p>In an earlier statement, the Vatican said Pope Francis was being treated for &#8220;symptomatic Diverticular Stenosis&#8221; of the colon.</p>



<p>The disease can lead to bulges in the wall of the large intestine and a narrowing of the colon.</p>



<p>Symptoms typically include bloating, reoccurring abdominal pain, and changes in bowel movements.</p>



<p>A week earlier, he asked his followers to pray for him in a plea that might have hinted at his op.</p>



<p>Pope Francis had told the crowd: “I ask you to pray for the Pope, pray in a special way.”</p>

<p><strong>SHOCKING footage shows the moment an enormous fireball burst into the sky after a mystery explosion in the Caspian Sea.</strong></p>



<p>The blast is reportedly being investigated by Azerbaijan&#8217;s government, which has for now blamed the towering inferno on a volcanic eruption &#8211; but the cause has been disputed.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15491277" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7e0b681b-74db-4ea6-bcba-9ffef0ce485d.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15491277" width="960" height="633" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>A mystery explosion in the Caspian Sea caused flames to shoot into the night sky[/caption]

<figure id="attachment_15491289" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/76419816-ed94-4d6c-8e27-b6dca5325352.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15491289" width="960" height="628" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>It is being investigated by officials[/caption]



<p>Dramatic clips and pictures show smoke billowing from the sea after flames shot into the night sky off the coast of Azerbaijan.</p>



<p>There were fears on social media that a rig or tanker had been destroyed in an explosion in the Umid gas field.</p>



<p>But rumours were squashed by Azerbaijan Caspian Shipping Company, who denied a blast had taken place.</p>



<p>A statement said: &#8220;There are some people on social networks who link the incident in the Caspian Sea with the explosion of a tanker. </p>



<p>&#8220;No explosion occurred on any ship belonging to the Azerbaijani Caspian Shipping Company.&#8221;</p>



<p>In an initial statement, the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) said a mud volcano had erupted.</p>



<p>But this was later edited, and the mention of a &#8220;mud volcano&#8221; was removed.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15491331" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3745e285-7696-4834-af7c-a53913fdf243.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15491331" width="960" height="637" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty</figcredit></figure>The cause of the explosion has not been confirmed[/caption]



<p>SOCAR representative Ibrahim Ahmadov said: &#8220;No accidents have occurred on marine platforms and industrial facilities under the direct control of SOCAR, and the work continues in normal mode.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will inform the public if there is any additional information.&#8221;</p>



<p>Authorities are investigating the cause of blast, which has been put down to an &#8220;erupting mud volcano&#8221; by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and the Republican Seismological Service Center.</p>



<p>Gurban Yetirmishli, director of the Republican Seismological Service Center, said: &#8220;Volcanoes often erupt in the Caspian Sea. It is a volcano near the Umid gas field. </p>



<p>&#8220;The rapid extinguishing of the explosion is also a sign of this.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are many volcanoes in the Caspian Sea. A volcanic island formed in the Caspian Sea in 2000. The waves washed it away. </p>



<p>&#8220;If there was a gas field, it would take days to put out the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>CAROLINE Crouch&#8217;s killer husband smiled &#8220;like he was on a cruise&#8221; after being arrested at her memorial, according to reports.</p>



<p>Brit <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15414859/something-terrible-shocked-caroline-crouch-killed-secret-diary/">Caroline Crouch, 20,</a> was smothered to death by husband <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15314219/who-caroline-crouch-husband-babis-anagnostopoulos/">Charalambos “Babis” Anagnostopoulos</a> as their one-year-old daughter Lydia lay nearby, before he staged an elaborate fake robbery scene at her home in Greece.</p>

<figure id="attachment_15490547" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 644px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000660035657.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=634" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15490547" width="634" height="403" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Tlive</figcredit></figure>The moment Babis Anagnostopoulos hugged the grieving mother of Caroline Crouch at her memorial[/caption]



<p>A police spokesman said Babis was discovered handcuffed to the floor near Caroline’s body and had duct tape over his eyes and mouth when they entered the scene.</p>



<p>But the 33-year-old later <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15311510/greek-husband-confesses-murdering-caroline-crouch/">confessed to strangling his wife last month</a> and he has since <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15362406/caroline-crouch-husband-blame-wish-could-go-back/">apologised for his crime </a>&#8211; admitting he &#8220;lost his temper.&#8221;</p>



<p>And a witness to his arrest has now revealed he was “smiling” as he was taken away by cops during a memorial service for his wife.</p>



<p>Captain Dimitris Anthimos told <a href="https://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/1139971/apokalupsi-i-mustiki-epiheirisi-tis-elas-gia-tin-metafora-tou-dolofonou-tis-karolain-stin-athina-gelouse-o-dolofonos/">protothema.gr</a>: &#8220;I have not seen a better actor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;He was smiling, as if he were going on a cruise.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Babis was then taken by boat from Alonissos to Skiathos.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15480092" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000653755453.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15480092" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>Social Media - Refer to Source</figcredit></figure>Caroline and Babis&#8217;s smiles on social media hid an reportedly abusive and unhappy marriage[/caption]



<p>It comes after Caroline&#8217;s mum is reported to have given her daughter&#8217;s killer husband £17,000 just ten days before he killed her and lied to cops.</p>



<p>Greek media reports Susan Dela Cuesta handed the sum to Babis Anagnostopoulos&nbsp;just over a week before he smothered his Brit wife and staged an elaborate fake robbery scene. </p>



<p>Family lawyer Thanassis Harmanis is reported to have said that just before the killing Babis was given 20,000 Euros by his mum-in-law.</p>



<p>Harmanis also claimed that the family gave him 2,000 Euros to transport Caroline&#8217;s body and 2,200 Euros for a coffin, reports <a href="https://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/1139711/dikigoros-oikogeneias-kraouts-i-mitera-tis-karolain-deka-meres-prin-ti-dolofonia-edose-ston-piloto-20000-euro/">Protothema</a> and <a href="https://www.skai.gr/news/greece/xarmanis-skai-i-mitera-karolain-edose-20000-piloto-10-meres-prin-dolofonia">Skai</a>. </p>



<p>He was hitting back at reports that the pilot, 32, claimed &#8211; during an interview from prison &#8211; he paid for Caroline&#8217;s coffin.</p>



<p>It was initially reported exclusively by The Sun that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15411588/caroline-crouch-husband-ask-parents-pay-coffin/">he had asked her parents for the cash</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement, Harmanis said: &#8220;How much is the truth of the claim of a man who for 37 days forced the authorities to look for 3 robbers who [killed] the mother of his child and their dog?</p>



<p>&#8220;The amazing direction, the unparalleled acting talent brought tears to the eyes of people with empathy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Anagnostopoulos <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15311510/greek-husband-confesses-murdering-caroline-crouch/">confessed to suffocating his wife last month</a> &#8211; claiming he killed her during a row after she vowed to leave him.</p>



<p>He then meticulously covered his tracks &#8211; including removing memory cards from CCTV cameras &#8211; and told cops she was killed by a gang of robbers.</p>



<p>The shameless killer &#8211; who for over a month lied to police, her parents and the world about her death &#8211; has since apologised for his crime.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15480085" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000662652761.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15480085" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>thenewspaper.gr</figcredit></figure>Caroline&#8217;s mother Susan Dela Cuesta reportedly gave Babis some £17,000[/caption]



<p>However, Greek cops have hinted there may be another motive and Babis&#8217;s finances have come under scrutiny from detectives.</p>



<p>His lavish lifestyle has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15398352/caroline-crouch-killer-husband-drug-run-links/">sparked suspicion over potential drug involvement</a> &#8211; and this week sources revealed fears he may have been <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15457755/caroline-crouchs-killer-husband-smuggled-drugs-cops-fear-2/">smuggling drugs in his chopper</a>.</p>



<p>The couple had recently been on a luxury holiday to Dubai and had also spent £47,000 on land and designed a £140,000 dream home.</p>



<p>Meanwhile Caroline’s dad,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15423198/caroline-crouchs-grieving-dad-killer/">David Crouch told The Sun his daughter had a strong &#8221;sense of right and wrong&#8221;&nbsp;</a>and would have threatened to leave her husband had she found out he was involved.</p>



<p>He added he believed there was &#8221;some foundation&#8221; to rumours in the Greek press that the killer pilot was also linked to drug smuggling.</p>



<p>Last week a source of crime journalist Angeliki Nikolouli hinted that Caroline<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15414859/something-terrible-shocked-caroline-crouch-killed-secret-diary/">&nbsp;might had seen something that shocked her</a> before her death.</p>



<p>It is believed that the young Brit was using her coded diary to record the abusive behaviour of her husband.</p>



<p>But her husband who is currently in the &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15400488/caroline-crouchs-husband-vip-prison-wing/">&#8221;VIP&#8221; wing</a>&nbsp;in Korydallos prison,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15444203/caroline-crouchs-husband-secret-diary-abuse-coded/">insisted his wife was not keeping a diary</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_15480095" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 970px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000660879672.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-15480095" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption><figcredit>AP</figcredit></figure>Babis confessed to killing her &#8211; but claims it was by accident in a fit of rage[/caption]



<p>&#8221;I am not persuaded that this is a crime conducted in a fit of rage, a crime of passion,&#8221; said Thanassis Katineropoulos who heads the union of Greek police officers.</p>



<p>&#8221;I believe it was premeditated,&#8221; he told Open TV.</p>



<p>&#8221;I hope the investigating magistrate goes all the way so the truth can be learned and justice rendered.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, amid the wider theories about her death &#8211; Caroline&#8217;s marriage appears to have been <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15367344/caroline-crouchs-heartbreaking-diary-code/">unhappy and abusive</a>.</p>
